### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  **Classification: procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet marks a transition away from substantive portfolio/acquisition discussion (“**is there anything that you'd be looking for thematically to add to your portfolio**”) into call wrap-up language (“**This concludes our question and answer session…**” / “**Thanks again for participating…**”), indicating a structural closure of the interactive segment rather than continuation of the prior thematic thread.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the content shifts from qualitative acquisition criteria (“**Strong consumer brands… well-defined consumer targets… under-penetrated opportunities**”) to qualitative closing remarks (“**We hope… remain safe… look forward to updating you**”) without introducing quantified metrics.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.959; delta_after=0.807; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  For the **relevant** cumulative tone dimension, the slope proxy indicates **stable (slightly lower) accumulation intensity**, consistent with the movement from content-rich Q&A narration to lower-information closing formalities while maintaining broadly similar cumulative tone momentum.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: The local peak check reports **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=94**, indicating a pronounced, episodic burst of quote updates within the local window.
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency** shows a positive deviation (**local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 11.3636**), indicating higher quote-update activity locally than the session baseline.
- Market Session context (Pre-Market): Given **pre-market** liquidity constraints and a limited-liquidity baseline, an elevation in quote revision frequency and modestly higher trading activity (e.g., **Trade_Volume deviation = 59.036 shares**) is appropriately interpreted relative to the session baseline rather than on absolute scale; wider dispersion in spreads is generally expected in this session (and given negatives in spread data, only dispersion/range is appropriately reported).
