No Change Point PACKETS were provided for the Q&A segment (QA) of TDG 2021 Q2, and the data context states that **no change points were detected across all dimensions**. Accordingly, there are **no packet-level timestamps (Transcript seconds) or dimensions** on which to instantiate the required Change Point template.  

Given this constraint, **packet-specific** (A–D) analyses are **Unavailable in provided data**. Below is the session-level interpretive context that can be stated **without** introducing any unobserved local inflections.

## Change Point at Transcript Unavailable (Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Unavailable.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance. **Unavailable in provided data.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Unavailable in provided data.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts. **Unavailable in provided data (no detected change points; no packet excerpts provided).**

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence. **Unavailable in provided data (no packet-level numeric cues or excerpts).**

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable.**
- Interpret: **Unavailable in provided data** (no dimension-specific change-point slopes reported for QA).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (no local evidence blocks were provided because no QA change points were detected).
- Reason: **No change points detected; therefore no local windows/deviation tables are available.**
- Session baseline context (Regular session):  
  - In Regular trading hours, higher baseline activity and broader dispersion across microstructure measures are typical; interpretation generally emphasizes variability rather than isolated spikes.  
  - Baseline panel (Regular) indicates wide dispersion in **Bid–Ask Spread** (range: **-2 to 2**, dispersion only), **Order Book Imbalance** (range: **-1 to 1**), and substantial variability in **Trade Count** (max **61**) and **Trade Volume** (max **4,169** shares per bin), consistent with heterogeneous intraday liquidity conditions.
