## Change Point at Transcript 2625.093s (and Dimension assertive)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (excerpt-based): The Q&A pivots from a sustainability characterization of “these other forms” to a new analyst-initiated line of inquiry on “pricing dynamics, particularly on the bars business,” marking a tracked departure from product-form resilience toward pricing and merchandising mechanics.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint indicates no numeric cues** (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False), and the excerpts are primarily qualitative framing (e.g., “you’re not worried about the sustainability…” versus “ask about pricing dynamics…”), without explicit quantified disclosures in the change-point excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.152; delta_after=0.381; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret (Accumulated Communication): Within the **assertive** dimension, the steepening suggests a higher rate of accumulated assertive tone immediately after the inflection, consistent with a more forceful, operationally oriented pricing discussion being introduced into the interaction stream.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=4** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -65.2365** (local volume below baseline mean).
- Session context (Pre-Market): In **Pre-Market**, liquidity is typically limited and response magnitudes are best interpreted relative to a thinner baseline; here, the local window shows **wider average spreads than baseline** (Bid_Ask_Spread deviation **+0.0466667**) alongside **lower-than-baseline quoting intensity** (Quote_Revision_Frequency deviation **-3.11111**) and **lower-than-baseline trading activity** (Trade_Count deviation **-0.551724**), co-occurring with the topic shift to pricing dynamics.


## Change Point at Transcript 2625.093s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (excerpt-based): The discourse transitions from an optimistic sustainability framing (“continue to grow that business… not worried about the sustainability”) to an analyst question probing “pricing benefit” and potential “declines in pricing year on year,” representing a tracked move from demand-form continuity toward commercialization frictions.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: The **numeric cue hint is false on both sides**, and the excerpts are qualitative and interrogative (pricing dynamics conjecture) rather than explicit numerical reporting in the change-point excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.086; delta_after=0.07; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret (Accumulated Communication): For the **optimistic** dimension, the stable slope indicates that the inflection does not coincide with a marked increase in optimistic tone momentum; the interaction reorients to pricing scrutiny without materially amplifying optimistic accumulation.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=4** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -4.32233** (lower local volatility proxy than baseline mean).
- Session context (Pre-Market): Under **Pre-Market** conditions, subdued trading and quoting relative to baseline can still be informative given limited liquidity; in this window the data show **spread levels above baseline mean** (Bid_Ask_Spread deviation **+0.0466667**) but **reduced quote revisions** (deviation **-3.11111**) and **reduced trading volume** (Trade_Volume deviation **-65.2365**), temporally aligned with the shift from optimistic sustainability framing to pricing-related questioning.


## Change Point at Transcript 2625.093s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (excerpt-based): The Q&A shifts from a broad characterization about the “sustainability of trends in those forms” to a more narrowly scoped probe into “pricing dynamics… visibility into the measured channel data… pullback in promotional activity,” constituting a tracked movement toward granular pricing/merchandising specificity.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: The **numeric cue hint remains False** before and after, and the excerpts rely on qualitative descriptors and conditional language (e.g., “Would I be right in thinking…”) rather than explicit point estimates or quantified metrics within the excerpted change-point boundary.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.107; delta_after=0.562; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret (Accumulated Communication): In the **specific** dimension, the sharp steepening from negative to strongly positive delta is consistent with a pronounced increase in specificity accumulation at and after the inflection, aligning with the interaction’s move into more detailed pricing/promotional mechanics.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=4** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.0466667** (local spreads wider than baseline mean).
- Session context (Pre-Market): Given **Pre-Market** liquidity constraints, spreads are often more variable and trades can be sparse; in this packet’s local window, the wider mean spread relative to baseline co-occurs with **lower quote-revision frequency** (deviation **-3.11111**) and **lower trade volume** (deviation **-65.2365**), temporally aligned with the transition toward a more specific pricing-focused line of questioning.
