### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**we're hopeful that as countries in our region continue taking the necessary actions to control this health crisis, we should start seeing a more robust recovery, fewer restrictions, and improving traffic patterns**.”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The packet marks a transition from contemporaneous downside framing (“**continue to struggle with the virus… reimpose their travel restrictions… reduction in our planned capacity**”) to explicitly forward-looking recovery language and then an immediate pivot into results reporting (“**Now, I'll highlight some of our first quarter results**”).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the content shifts from qualitative macro/operational outlook (“**hopeful… more robust recovery… improving traffic patterns**”) to a procedural setup sentence (“**I'll highlight some of our first quarter results**”) without numeric disclosure in the immediate after-excerpt.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=-1e-05; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening**, consistent with a stabilization in cumulative tone momentum and a lower incremental “information injection” rate as the speaker closes a qualitative outlook segment and moves procedurally toward the results section.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**.
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check local_max=43** (within the 11:01:51–11:05:19 ET window).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -60.6509 shares** (below the Regular-session baseline mean).
- Regular-session context: With **Regular** hours providing a higher baseline for trades and quotes, the observed local window is characterized by **below-baseline trading activity and below-baseline quote updating** (e.g., Quote_Revision_Frequency deviation **-7.15541**), while spread values exhibit wide dispersion (range reported in local stats: **min -2 to max 2**) that should be interpreted as variability rather than direction given the presence of negatives.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Metric disclosure.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The packet delineates a shift within results narration from operating volume metrics (“**capacity… 2.5 billion… about 39%…**” and “**Load factor… 69%**”) to bottom-line performance disclosure (“**net loss of $110.7 million, or $2.60 per share**”), representing a structurally distinct informational category within the presentation flow.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=True; After_has_numeric_cue=True**, and both excerpts contain explicit quantitative metrics (e.g., “**2.5 billion… 39%**”, “**69%**”, and “**$110.7 million… $2.60 per share**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=9e-05; delta_after=-0.99962; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: **Steepening**, indicating a sharper change in cumulative tone momentum around the transition into loss-per-share disclosure, consistent with higher-intensity information flow in the Accumulated Communication trajectory.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**.
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check local_max=97** (within the 11:07:39–11:10:23 ET window).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 26.5946** (above the Regular-session baseline mean).
- Regular-session context: Relative to the **Regular** baseline (higher typical activity), this window shows **above-baseline quote updating and moderately higher trading activity** (e.g., Trade_Volume deviation **+172.998 shares**, Trade_Count deviation **+0.625**), alongside spread dispersion (local range **min -2 to max 2**) that is best summarized as variability given negative values.
