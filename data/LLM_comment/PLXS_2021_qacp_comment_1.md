## Change Point at Transcript 2825.745s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**certainly too early to talk about 22 and give any sort of, guide or color, but I think it's setting up to be a really good year**”
  - “**it still sets up to be a pretty good year or a growth year from a revenue standpoint**”
  - “**We do have the Thailand facility that's going to be ramping up**”
  - “**we expect some return [in travel expenses] at some point**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet marks a tracked departure because the dialogue moves from a supply-chain/inventory environment discussion to an outlook-oriented framing around fiscal 2022 set-up, fiscal 2021 “compelling story,” and prospective margin headwinds (Thailand ramp and travel expense normalization), indicating a forward-leaning narrative turn.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint indicates** Before_has_numeric_cue=False and After_has_numeric_cue=False; the shift is dominated by qualitative guidance language (“**too early to talk about 22**,” “**setting up to be a really good year**,” “**monitoring**” travel expenses), even though the surrounding exchange references numbers elsewhere.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.945; delta_after=0.929; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  In the **specific** dimension, the cumulative tone slope is **stable to marginally flattening** (0.945 → 0.929), consistent with **steady accumulated communication intensity** rather than an acceleration in specificity at the change point.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.
  - **Local observation:** Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check reports **local_max=1**, indicating no elevated quote-update peak within the local window relative to its observed maximum.
  - **Deviation-table highlight:** **Trade_Count local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.533333** (with **Trade_Volume +38.4 shares**) suggests modestly higher local trade activity than the session baseline mean during the window.
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  Given the **Pre-Market** session’s limited-liquidity baseline, the observed **modest positive deviations in trade count and volume** can be comparatively salient even at low absolute levels, while the local **Bid_Ask_Spread deviation (+0.0751)** is evaluated cautiously as consistent with wider and more variable pre-market quoting conditions.
