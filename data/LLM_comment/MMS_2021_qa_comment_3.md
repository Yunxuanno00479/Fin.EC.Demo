### 1) Q&A Focus (4–6 bullets)

- Reconciliation of FY22 organic growth expectations, with detailed walk-through of the FY21 organic revenue base, acquisition and COVID work layers, and implied growth needed to align with consensus.
- Sustainability and margin characteristics of key programs outside the U.S., especially the UK Restart contract, including post-furlough volume dynamics and outcomes-based contract protections.
- Role of federal and state exchanges, and potential future enrollment and workload implications as Medicaid redeterminations resume and proposed regulatory changes evolve.
- Integration of recent acquisitions (Attain Federal, VES) into the opportunity pipeline, including timing of expected pipeline contribution (notably beyond the two-year pipeline horizon).
- Clarification of VES and Attain performance and visibility, with emphasis on volume-based revenue characteristics and expectations for forward growth.
- Discussion of sales pipeline health and cadence by segment (U.S. Services, Outside U.S., Federal), and positioning toward higher-growth federal IT and digital services markets.

### 2) Multi-dimensional Accumulated Communication

- Across the Q&A window (seconds ~1987–3287), assertive, optimistic, specific, clear, and relevant cumulative tones all increase steadily, with no flagged structural breaks until the final exchange (around second 2952), where discrete change points appear.
- Specific and cautious dimensions show notably different profiles:
  - Specific cumulative tone rises strongly and almost monotonically from 0.94 to about 6.13, with high unit-level scores (0.79–0.95) and a late change point. This indicates increasingly information-dense, detail-oriented communication as the Q&A progresses.
  - Cautious cumulative tone remains modestly negative throughout (from roughly -0.06 to about -0.45) and exhibits only a small step change at the final question. The slope is relatively flat compared with the pronounced upward slope in specific tone.
- This divergence—strong positive accumulation in specific tone against a mildly negative, low-slope cautious tone—suggests that the Q&A segment is characterized more by detailed, concrete elaboration than by hedging or reservation, even when addressing uncertainties (e.g., exchange dynamics, pipeline timing).
- Optimistic cumulative tone also increases (from ~0.41 to ~3.12) but at a slower rate than specific and relevant tones, indicating that the communication momentum is anchored more in precision and relevance than in overtly upbeat language.

### 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Pre-Market)

Context: Pre-Market trading, where liquidity is typically limited and even moderate changes in activity or spreads can be meaningful relative to baseline.

Using the Q&A window (09:32:07–09:52:54 ET):

- **Bid-Ask Spread**
  - Local mean: 0.285 vs baseline mean: 0.226 (difference ≈ +0.06).
  - Both local and baseline distributions show a wide dispersion (std ~0.73–0.78; range from -2 to 2), with identical medians (0.014).
  - Interpretation: During the Q&A, spreads are slightly wider on average but remain within the broad dispersion typical of this Pre-Market session, with several extreme observations present in both samples.

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean: -0.134 vs baseline mean: -0.081 (difference ≈ -0.05).
  - Dispersion is similar (std ~0.46–0.49), with a symmetric range from -1 to 1 and median at 0 in both local and baseline windows.
  - Interpretation: The order book remains moderately tilted to the sell side on average, but the degree and dispersion of imbalance during Q&A are close to the Pre-Market baseline.

- **Quote Revision Frequency**
  - Local mean: 15.23 vs baseline mean: 10.33 (difference ≈ +4.90).
  - Local dispersion is high (std ~18.08) with a local maximum of 51 revisions, exceeding the baseline mean and consistent with the upper tail of the Pre-Market activity distribution.
  - Interpretation: The Q&A phase is associated with a higher average pace of quote updates and at least one pronounced local peak; this occurs against a limited-liquidity Pre-Market backdrop, so the relative elevation in quoting activity is notable even if absolute levels remain modest.

- **Quote Volatility**
  - Local mean: 24.39 vs baseline mean: 25.25 (difference ≈ -0.86).
  - Medians are high in both samples (local 33.39 vs baseline 32.52) with similar dispersion, though the local maximum (~41.7) is somewhat below the baseline maximum (~60.9).
  - Interpretation: Price-related volatility intensity during Q&A is comparable to the broader Pre-Market session, with no strong deviation in the volatility proxy.

- **Trade Count**
  - Local mean: 4.64 vs baseline mean: 4.38 (difference ≈ +0.26).
  - Both windows show high dispersion (std ~9.3–8.9) and a similar range (1 to high-teens/40s).
  - Interpretation: Trade incidence during the Q&A is slightly above the already variable Pre-Market baseline, but differences are modest relative to the underlying dispersion.

- **Trade Volume**
  - Local mean: 299.6 shares vs baseline mean: 320.7 shares (difference ≈ -21.1 shares).
  - Dispersion remains large in both samples (std ~572 vs 649), with similar ranges and low medians (100 shares).
  - Interpretation: Executed share volume during Q&A is broadly in line with the Pre-Market baseline, with substantial variability and no pronounced local elevation in average size.

Overall, in this Pre-Market context, the Q&A window co-occurs with:

- Slightly wider but still highly dispersed spreads.
- Order book conditions similar to baseline.
- A meaningfully higher rate of quote revisions, including a local peak, against otherwise comparable volatility and trading intensity.
