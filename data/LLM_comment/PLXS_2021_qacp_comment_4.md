## Change Point at Transcript 2317.397s (and Dimension assertive)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**relative to your forward guidance**”
  - “**sequential growth in each of the quarters in FY22**”
  - “**how much confidence or visibility do you have** … **in advance** …”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet marks a departure from contemporaneous cost/constraint management (“labor and raw material inflation… combating the labor constraints”) toward a forward-looking interrogation of guidance attainability and component visibility for FY22, explicitly framed around confidence/visibility.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the shift is primarily qualitative (e.g., “**how much confidence or visibility** … **securing or procuring those components**” and inventory being “**set aside for Q2, Q3**”), rather than introducing new contemporaneous metrics in the excerpted question transition.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.151; delta_after=0.422; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening** is consistent with a higher intensity of accumulated communication in the *assertive* dimension around this transition, aligning with a move into firmer, guidance-referenced language and a higher-stakes framing (“confidence/visibility”) relative to the immediately preceding cost-pass-through discussion.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within local window [2021-10-28 09:01:21.491000 , 2021-10-28 09:14:33.365000].**
  - Therefore, **local observations and local-vs-baseline deviations are Unavailable in provided data.**
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context):  
  In the **Pre-Market** session, liquidity baselines are typically limited; the provided session panel reports **Bid_Ask_Spread mean=0.982** and **Quote_Revision_Frequency mean=1**, while **Trade_Count, Trade_Volume, and Quote_Volatility are Unavailable in provided data** (no session-level observations reported for those fields beyond missing values). Any potential microstructure co-movements around this change point cannot be assessed without local evidence, and wide spreads can be consistent with pre-market trading conditions.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**relative to your forward guidance**”
  - “**sequential growth in each of the quarters in FY22**”
  - “**how much confidence or visibility** … **in advance of that**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet tracks a pivot from an operational cost/constraints query (“labor and raw material inflation… combating the labor constraints”) to a guidance-salient forward-looking query that explicitly evaluates the feasibility of sequential FY22 performance under supply constraints, thereby altering the relevance-weighted narrative emphasis.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  The numeric cue hint remains **False→False**, and the excerpted shift is qualitative and expectation-oriented (“**confidence or visibility**” regarding “**securing or procuring those components**”), rather than introducing new numeric disclosures within the before/after excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.717; delta_after=0.964; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **steepening** in the *relevant* cumulative tone indicates increased accumulated communication intensity at this point in the Q&A, consistent with the interaction moving toward guidance-linked, decision-relevant framing (visibility, sequencing across FY22 quarters) rather than a narrower discussion of inflation pass-through mechanics.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within local window [2021-10-28 09:01:21.491000 , 2021-10-28 09:14:33.365000].**
  - Therefore, **local observations and local-vs-baseline deviations are Unavailable in provided data.**
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context):  
  Under **Pre-Market** conditions, baseline trading is often thin and quote-based measures can be more informative than prints; however, in the provided session panel, only **Bid_Ask_Spread mean=0.982** and **Quote_Revision_Frequency mean=1** are available, while **Trade_Count, Trade_Volume, and Quote_Volatility are Unavailable in provided data**. Without local evidence, no packet-specific response alignment can be evaluated, and spread levels should be interpreted relative to the limited-liquidity pre-market baseline.
