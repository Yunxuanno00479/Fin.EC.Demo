## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–~750s)

- Extensive framing of COVID‑19 context: contrasting improving conditions in the U.S./Panama with continued disruption and renewed restrictions in several Latin American markets.
- Emphasis on gradual operational recovery: capacity rebounding to ~39% of 2019 levels, load factors improving through the quarter, and plans to restore the six‑bank hub structure and expand destinations.
- Mixed financial picture: sizable operating and net losses persist, but quarter‑over‑quarter improvement, reduced unit costs (ex‑fuel), and improved cash consumption levels are highlighted.
- Strong liquidity and balance‑sheet resilience: substantial cash and committed credit facilities, active use of aircraft financing and asset sales, and continued fleet modernization (737 MAX 9 deliveries; Embraer 190 exits).
- Cost discipline and structural efficiency: focus on achieving lower structural unit costs once pre‑COVID capacity is reached, positioning the hub as a cost‑efficient regional connector.
- Forward‑looking but cautious messaging: explicit acknowledgement of high uncertainty and withdrawal of full‑year guidance, balanced by constructive expectations for traffic recovery and strategic strengthening of the hub model.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Early operator and IR remarks (0–~120s) keep cumulative tone near neutral, with modest negative dips around the risk‑disclosure segment (~90–115s).
- The CEO’s introductory gratitude and employee‑recognition remarks (~117–145s) coincide with a sharp positive steepening, pushing cumulative tone well into positive territory.
- Discussion of deteriorating demand, infection waves, and restrictive conditions (~156–200s) is associated with pronounced negative tone swings, briefly pulling the cumulative series down, followed by a marked positive inflection at the hopeful recovery statement (~214s, flagged as a change point).
- From ~220s onward, as management details improving load factors, revenues, lower ex‑fuel unit costs, liquidity build‑up, operational metrics, and hub/fleet plans, the cumulative tone climbs steadily, with several near‑maximally positive sentences, indicating a sustained and steep positive slope.
- The CFO’s section maintains a generally positive slope, though with localized flattening and mild pullbacks when reporting net losses, special items, and the decision not to provide full‑year guidance (~520–685s).
- Late‑stage commentary on cost positioning, liquidity, capacity and revenue outlook for Q2, and long‑term competitive advantages (~700–750s) is again strongly positive, and the cumulative tone by the end of the Presentation is substantially above its early‑call level, indicating high and persistent “information injection intensity” in a positive direction after the initial risk segment.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

Context:  
- Regular trading session with relatively high baseline liquidity and active quoting.
- Interpretation focuses on deviations from this already elevated baseline rather than on absolute levels.

**Bid‑Ask Spread & Order Book**

- Average bid‑ask spread during the Presentation is slightly wider than the session mean (local −0.222 vs baseline −0.244; difference ≈ +0.02), with similar dispersion; given the Regular session, this suggests spreads are broadly in line with typical intraday conditions, with no pronounced tightening or sustained stress.
- Order book imbalance is very close to baseline (local 0.136 vs 0.141), indicating that buy‑vs‑sell pressure in the book remains broadly balanced relative to the rest of the session; no marked skew in one direction is observed.

**Quote Dynamics**

- Quote revision frequency is modestly higher than baseline (local mean 30.8 vs 29.4; deviation +1.39), and the local maximum (97) reaches the overall session peak.
- Quote volatility is essentially aligned with baseline (19.84 vs 19.95; deviation −0.11), with comparable dispersion.
- For a Regular session, this pattern suggests that, during the Presentation window, quoting activity is slightly more intense on average, with occasional bursts of very rapid updates, while the overall volatility in quotes remains typical for the session.

**Trades and Volumes**

- Trade count is marginally below the session mean (3.53 vs 3.75; deviation −0.22), with similar variability. This indicates that the number of trades per bin during the Presentation is close to, but not above, the usual Regular‑session baseline.
- Trade volume per bin is slightly higher than baseline (272 vs 257 shares; deviation +14.8), with a similar range and upper tail.
- Given the Regular session’s already elevated activity, these trade metrics suggest that trading during the Presentation co‑occurs with near‑normal frequency but somewhat larger average trade size, rather than a distinct surge in trade intensity.

**Overall**

- During the Presentation phase, market microstructure indicators are broadly consistent with the Regular session baseline:
  - Spreads and order book balance remain typical.
  - Quoting activity shows slightly elevated intensity, with evidence of localized peaks.
  - Trading activity (counts and volumes) appears normal‑to‑slightly‑above‑normal in size, but not in frequency.
- Within the Regular session context, the Presentation window thus aligns with an environment of active but not unusually stressed or subdued trading, co‑occurring with a strongly upward‑sloping cumulative tone after the early risk disclosures.
