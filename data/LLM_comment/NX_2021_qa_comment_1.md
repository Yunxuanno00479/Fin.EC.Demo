## 1) Q&A Focus (4–6 bullets)

- Clarification of Q1 revenue drivers, with management emphasizing volume-led growth and emerging, but still secondary, pricing effects; detailed discussion of medical claims normalization using 2019–2020 as a benchmark.  
- Extensive focus on end-market demand patterns: EU vs North America fenestration, the role of renovation vs new construction, COVID-related reallocation of discretionary spending, and regulatory energy-efficiency frameworks.  
- Repeated probing of labor constraints across segments (particularly cabinet components in Minnesota/Wisconsin), including implications for costs (overtime), shipment capacity, and the strategic role of automation and HR initiatives.  
- Detailed exploration of North American fenestration mix and growth: screens vs IGE vs profiles, evidence of above-market growth in screens, backlog dynamics constrained by installer labor, and discussion of freight conditions and reshoring/in-sourcing tendencies.  
- Cabinet segment questions on margin improvement, yield benefits from new assets, timing of asset anniversaries, and views on demand sustainability and possible upside given semi-custom strength and homeowner equity.  
- Capital allocation and governance wrap-up: inquiries on share repurchases under the remaining authorization, management’s valuation stance, and a brief closing acknowledgment of a retiring board member.

## 2) Multi-dimensional Accumulated Communication

- **Assertive vs cautious:**  
  - Assertive cumulative tone increases steadily from approximately 0.13 around 882 seconds to about 7.49 by the end of Q&A (~2228 seconds), indicating a sustained, confident communication stance.  
  - Cautious cumulative tone moves in the opposite direction, from slightly negative at the outset (around -0.02) to a more negative reading near -1.62 by the end, without any flagged change points.  
  - This combination suggests that, over the Q&A, management’s answers remain consistently firm while references to risk, uncertainty, or conditional language remain present but incrementally subdued in slope relative to assertiveness (i.e., caution does not intensify over time).

- **Optimistic and clear:**  
  - Optimistic cumulative tone climbs smoothly from roughly 0.08 to about 5.45, particularly around discussions of EU demand, screen growth, freight-related “tailwinds”, and capacity utilization, with no structural breaks detected.  
  - Clear cumulative tone rises from about 0.51 at the start of Q&A to roughly 7.92 by the closing remarks, indicating persistent informational clarity (especially in quantitative responses on market growth, share gains, capacity, and capital allocation).

- **Specific vs cautious (slope comparison):**  
  - Specific cumulative tone increases from near zero at the start of questioning to roughly 7.92 by the end, with a largely monotonic profile and no change points. Responses repeatedly include quantification (e.g., growth rates, capacity percentages, freight mechanics, timing of asset installations and screen-plant openings).  
  - Cautious tone remains mildly negative and relatively flat in absolute magnitude compared with the strong upward slope in specificity.  
  - The divergence between the **strongly upward “specific” trajectory** and the **relatively stable, modestly negative “cautious” trajectory** indicates that, as Q&A progresses, answers become increasingly detailed and operationally concrete without a parallel escalation in expressed caution.

- **Relevance:**  
  - Relevant cumulative tone is high throughout, rising from about 0.92 to approximately 19.06, consistent with questions and answers tightly anchored to core segments (fenestration, cabinets), key themes (labor, automation, freight, energy efficiency), and financial metrics (growth vs market, margins, buybacks).

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

Using the Regular-session baseline as reference, and focusing on the Q&A window (approximately 881–2250 seconds):

- **Bid-ask spread (USD):**  
  - Local mean ≈ 0.0293 vs baseline mean ≈ 0.0266 (difference ≈ +0.0027).  
  - Dispersion is somewhat higher locally (std ≈ 0.39 vs 0.33), with the full range spanning from -2 to 2 in both the baseline and Q&A window.  
  - Interpretation: during Regular hours, this very small positive deviation in the mean spread suggests spreads are broadly comparable to the session norm; the wider dispersion indicates some bins with more extreme quotes, but this is not unusual given the overall range observed for the day.

- **Order book imbalance (unitless):**  
  - Local mean ≈ 0.076 vs baseline mean ≈ 0.093 (difference ≈ -0.017).  
  - Dispersion (std ≈ 0.32) is similar to baseline (≈ 0.33), and the range remains from -1 to 1.  
  - Interpretation: no pronounced shift in imbalance patterns; the distribution during Q&A appears broadly similar to the Regular-session backdrop, with no distinctive intensification or reduction in imbalance suggested by the aggregate statistics.

- **Quote activity and volatility:**  
  - Quote revision frequency: local mean ≈ 18.76 vs baseline ≈ 20.24 (difference ≈ -1.47), with a relatively high local standard deviation (≈ 22.13) and a local maximum at 100.  
  - Quote volatility: local mean ≈ 2.58 vs baseline ≈ 3.36 (difference ≈ -0.78), with similar dispersion (std ≈ 3.80 vs 4.21).  
  - Interpretation: during Q&A, quote updates and short-horizon volatility are **slightly below** their Regular-session averages, but remain variable with occasional spikes (e.g., local maximum in quote revisions). For a Regular session, this points to generally normal intraday quoting behavior with episodic bursts rather than a systematically elevated response over the phase.

- **Trading intensity (count and volume):**  
  - Trade count: local mean ≈ 2.84 vs baseline ≈ 3.04 (difference ≈ -0.20), with comparable dispersion (std ≈ 3.14 vs 4.03) and a maximum of 16 trades per bin locally vs 32 in the full session.  
  - Trade volume: local mean ≈ 362 shares per bin vs baseline ≈ 320 (difference ≈ +42), with higher local dispersion (std ≈ 1,287 vs 1,052) and a similar maximum (≈ 10,781 shares).  
  - Interpretation: during Regular hours, the **number** of trades per bin is slightly below the session average, but the **average volume per bin** is somewhat higher with more dispersion. This suggests that, across the Q&A window, trade activity is not unusually frequent, but some bins feature relatively larger trade sizes compared to the session norm.

- **Summary of local vs baseline during Q&A (Regular session):**  
  - Across spreads, order-book imbalance, quote activity, and volatility, the Q&A window appears broadly in line with Regular-session conditions, with only modest deviations in means.  
  - The most notable difference is a mild elevation in average trade volume (with greater dispersion) despite slightly fewer trades per bin, indicating that, over the Q&A interval, trading remains active in size but not unusually intense in frequency when judged against the intraday baseline.
