### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking phrases (quoted):
  - “**setting ourselves up for a strong position into 22**”
  - “**What we’re counting on is a… consistent, steady recovery**”
- One-sentence why tracked: The interaction pivots from discussing assumptions around international recovery visibility (“**I don’t have that visibility**…“**it’s not so clear**”) to a new forward-oriented capital-structure and deployment line of questioning (“**maximum leverage**…“**appetite for large versus small deals**”), constituting a departure in the cumulative narrative trajectory.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: The packet moves from largely qualitative uncertainty about regional recovery and planning (“**I don’t have that visibility**”) to numerically anchored balance-sheet discussion in the follow-on exchange (numeric cue present After), including “**6.0 times**” and deal-size ranges (“**below $100 million, up to a couple billion**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.395; delta_after=0.502; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **assertive** cumulative tone steepens, consistent with a higher-intensity injection of more definitive positioning as the dialogue shifts toward leverage tolerance and capital deployment framing.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 28** (local_max=28).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +27.5053** (shares per bin), alongside **Trade_Count = +0.161376**.
- Session context (Regular): In Regular hours, baseline activity is higher and dispersion is expected; the observed **positive deviation in trade volume** is therefore interpreted as a notable co-occurrence relative to the session mean, even while other microstructure dimensions (e.g., quote revisions) are not elevated versus baseline (deviation **−10.8024** for Quote_Revision_Frequency). Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (range in local stats: **min −2 to max 2**).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Risk management pivot.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The exchange transitions from medium-term profitability framing (including reluctance to provide long-term guidance) to a risk- and uncertainty-laden defense discussion around the IG report (“**potential for some disruption**,” “**we’re still in the dark**”), marking a tracked change in how management conditions expectations.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: The “Before” question explicitly requests numeric benchmarking (“**Is 50% the new level?**”), while the subsequent content emphasizes conditionality and limited visibility (“**possible**,” “**still in the dark on the report and some of its details**”) with no new numerical anchors (numeric cue hint After_has_numeric_cue=False).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.379; delta_after=0.317; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **assertive** accumulation remains broadly stable, consistent with a continuation of information flow but with less incremental assertive momentum as the packet moves into conditional, process-oriented discussion.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184** (local_max=184).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +16.4551**, with **Quote_Volatility = +84.0392**.
- Session context (Regular): During Regular hours, higher quote/trade activity is common; within that context, the **elevated quote revisions and volatility proxy relative to baseline** are observed alongside **lower trade volume deviation** (Trade_Volume **−24.7609**), suggesting a response profile more concentrated in quoting dynamics than in executed volume. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Procedural transition.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The dialogue moves from a boundary-setting clarification on leverage communication (“**we’re not giving guidance on the denominator**…“**don’t do it**”) to operational/expense cadence questions (business travel budgeting) (“**stepping up a little bit, but not quite to pre-COVID levels**”), reflecting a tracked shift from guidance constraints to operational normalization.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: Both sides are dominated by qualitative positioning rather than quantified disclosures—explicitly “**we’re not giving guidance**” and “**I don’t have the exact stats in front of me**,” consistent with the numeric cue hints (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.351; delta_after=0.428; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **assertive** cumulative tone steepens, consistent with increased communication intensity as management shifts from denying a numeric inference attempt to more forceful operational posture (“**we’re not holding back at all**,” “**business as usual**”).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184** (local_max=184).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +28.3996**, with **Quote_Volatility = +124.545**.
- Session context (Regular): Relative to a higher-liquidity Regular-hours baseline, the **substantially higher quoting activity and volatility proxy** are observed alongside **lower executed activity** (Trade_Count **−0.386243**, Trade_Volume **−45.4471**), indicating that local responses in this window are more aligned with quotation updates than with trades. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

## Change Point at Transcript 1912.535s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking phrases (quoted):
  - “**setting ourselves up for a strong position into 22**”
  - “**What we’re counting on is a… consistent, steady recovery**”
- Interaction challenge/uncertainty (supported by excerpts): Management explicitly notes uncertainty/limited visibility (“**I don’t have that visibility**,” “**it’s not so clear**,” “**is the recovery in China, does that happen?**”).
- One-sentence why tracked: The packet reorients the optimistic narrative from conditional planning language about recovery to a distinct forward-looking framing that becomes a bridge into capital-structure capacity and acquisition flexibility, representing a discontinuity in the cumulative communication path.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: The “After” content introduces numeric anchors (numeric cue hint After_has_numeric_cue=True), exemplified by “**6.0 times**” leverage and transaction sizing (“**below $100 million… up to a couple billion**”), versus the preceding emphasis on qualitative planning and uncertain regional recovery.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.312; delta_after=0.475; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **optimistic** cumulative tone steepening is consistent with heightened positive-forward momentum as the discussion broadens from recovery ambiguity to durability and financial capacity themes.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 28**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +27.5053**.
- Session context (Regular): Against a relatively active Regular-hours baseline, the **local positive trade-volume deviation** is observed alongside lower quote-revision deviation (−10.8024), consistent with a response pattern that is more pronounced in trading volume than in quoting frequency during this interval. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Risk management pivot.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The conversation pivots from medium-term margin trajectory framing (“**improve by about one percentage point per year**”) into conditional defense/IG-report uncertainty (“**potential for some disruption**,” “**still in the dark**”), altering the optimistic contour of the exchange toward risk-qualified language.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: The “Before” segment contains an explicit numeric performance frame (“**50%**”) while the “After” segment shifts to uncertainty and process language without fresh numeric commitments (After_has_numeric_cue=False).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.327; delta_after=0.348; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **optimistic** accumulation remains stable, suggesting that while the topic becomes more risk-qualified, overall optimistic momentum does not sharply decelerate within the packet.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +84.0392** (and Quote_Revision_Frequency **+16.4551**).
- Session context (Regular): In Regular hours, elevated quote updates can occur, yet the **above-baseline quote revisions and volatility proxy** co-occur with **below-baseline trade volume** (−24.7609), indicating a locally more quote-intensive response profile. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

## Change Point at Transcript 1912.535s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking phrases (quoted):
  - “**setting ourselves up for a strong position into 22**”
  - “**What we’re counting on is a… consistent, steady recovery**”
- Interaction challenge/uncertainty (supported by excerpts): “**I don’t have that visibility**,” “**it’s not so clear**,” and the conditional “**does that happen?**” around China.
- One-sentence why tracked: The packet transitions from specific but non-quantified planning rationale for aftermarket recovery to a more parameterized financial-policy discussion (numeric cue in the subsequent question/answer), shifting the specificity vector of the conversation.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: The “After” introduces explicit numeric markers (After_has_numeric_cue=True), including leverage (“**6.0 times**”) and deal sizing (“**below $100 million… up to a couple billion**”), whereas the “Before” emphasizes limited visibility and planning logic.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.732; delta_after=0.931; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **specific** cumulative tone steepening indicates intensified delivery of concrete parameters (financial thresholds/ranges), consistent with higher specificity in accumulated communication.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 28**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +27.5053**.
- Session context (Regular): Relative to the Regular-hours baseline, the positive **local trade-volume deviation** co-occurs with this specificity inflection, while quote revisions are below baseline (−10.8024), suggesting the local response is not primarily expressed through quote-update intensity. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Procedural transition.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The exchange moves from a numerically framed, medium-term margin discussion into a different Q&A thread (commercial aftermarket pent-up maintenance demand), representing a tracked transition in the line of inquiry rather than an extension of the prior metric-focused trajectory.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: The “Before” contains numeric framing (“**50%**,” “**free cash flow conversion**”), while the “After” turns to qualitative speculation and limited visibility (“**hard for us to know**,” “**we don’t get visibility**”), and the numeric cue hint indicates After_has_numeric_cue=False.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.7; delta_after=-0.026; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: The **specific** cumulative tone sharply flattens, consistent with a reduction in metric-level specificity as the interaction shifts into a less quantified, more exploratory aftermarket maintenance discussion.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +16.4551** (and Quote_Volatility **+84.0392**).
- Session context (Regular): During Regular hours, higher baseline liquidity applies; here the local window shows **above-baseline quote activity and volatility proxy** but **below-baseline trade volume** (−24.7609), aligning with a response pattern that is more quotation-intensive than trade-intensive. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

## Change Point at Transcript 2802.009s (and Dimension clear)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Risk management pivot.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The sequence transitions from relatively structured margin-path commentary into IG-report uncertainty and potential disruption language (“**potential for some disruption**,” “**still in the dark**”), changing the clarity profile from trajectory exposition to risk qualification.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: The initial question is metric-centric (“**Is 50% the new level?**”), whereas the subsequent exchange emphasizes uncertainty and lacks new numeric anchors (After_has_numeric_cue=False).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.852; delta_after=0.778; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **clear** cumulative tone remains broadly stable, suggesting maintained communicative structure despite the shift toward conditional risk language.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +84.0392**.
- Session context (Regular): Relative to Regular-hours baseline, the local window exhibits **higher quote revisions and volatility proxy** with **lower trade volume** (−24.7609), consistent with a local response profile concentrated in quote dynamics rather than executed volume. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Procedural transition.**
- One-sentence why tracked: The exchange moves from clarification and constraint-setting around leverage/EBITDA inference (“**we’re not giving guidance on the denominator**”) into routine operating-expense normalization (business travel) where management provides bounded qualitative direction (“**stepping up a little bit, but not quite to pre-COVID levels**”), constituting a tracked procedural handoff between Q&A threads.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: Both sides emphasize qualitative bounds and the absence of exact figures (“**not giving guidance**,” “**I don’t have the exact stats**”), consistent with the numeric cue hints indicating no numeric cue on either side.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.789; delta_after=0.865; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **clear** cumulative tone shows stable accumulation, indicating continuity in structured communication even as the content transitions from guidance limitation to operational commentary.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 184**.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +28.3996** (and Quote_Volatility **+124.545**).
- Session context (Regular): In Regular hours, baseline quoting/trading is typically higher; nevertheless, the local window shows **materially above-baseline quote revision frequency and volatility proxy**, while executed activity is **below baseline** (Trade_Count −0.386243; Trade_Volume −45.4471), indicating a locally quote-heavy response pattern. Bid-ask spread contains negatives; only dispersion is noted (local range: **min −2 to max 2**).
