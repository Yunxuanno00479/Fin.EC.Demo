### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition**.
- One-sentence why tracked: The narrative moves from agenda-setting (“**Then, Todd will discuss our financial results…**”) to substantive performance disclosure (“**net sales surpassed $1 billion in fiscal 2021**”), marking a departure from call structure into reported outcomes.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The “before” excerpt is organizational/process guidance without numbers, whereas the “after” excerpt introduces a quantified performance outcome (“**net sales surpassed $1 billion in fiscal 2021**”); consistent with **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=True**.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation suggests no material steepening/flattening in tone momentum at the inflection, despite the shift into more “hard” metric content.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** — *Reason:* No market rows found within the local window **08:31:55–08:34:40 ET**; therefore, packet-level local peaks/deviations cannot be assessed.
- Session baseline contextualization (Pre-Market): With **limited liquidity** as the relevant baseline, the panel indicates typically low trade intensity (median **Trade_Count=1**, median **Trade_Volume=33 shares**) and comparatively variable quoting (where available, **Quote_Revision_Frequency** spans **1 to 70**). Bid-ask spread exhibits a wide **range** (**min -2 to max 0.501 USD**), which is consistent with pre-market dispersion; no packet-specific deviation can be stated.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **metric disclosure**.
- One-sentence why tracked: The discourse transitions from a profitability summary metric (“**Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.9% to $48.5 million**”) to a line-item expense breakdown (“**Selling and marketing expense increased $6.3 million…**”), indicating a tracked pivot from aggregate performance to component detail.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard**.
- Justification: Both sides contain explicit numeric accounting content (EBITDA “**30.9%**… **$48.5 million**” and expense increase “**$6.3 million**”; consistent with **Before_has_numeric_cue=True; After_has_numeric_cue=True**).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.24132; delta_after=0.05792; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: **Flattening** indicates reduced incremental tone accumulation, consistent with a more routine, enumerative cadence typical of sequential P&L line-item disclosure.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** — *Reason:* No market rows found within the local window **08:44:53–08:47:58 ET**; therefore, packet-level local peaks/deviations cannot be assessed.
- Session baseline contextualization (Pre-Market): Relative to a **thin-liquidity** pre-market environment, the baseline shows low central tendency in trading (median **Trade_Count=1**, median **Trade_Volume=33 shares**) with occasional bursts (max **Trade_Count=41**, max **Trade_Volume=13,816 shares**). Quoting activity (when observed) is dispersed (Quote Revision Frequency **1–70**), and the bid-ask spread has a broad **range** (**-2 to 0.501 USD**), so wide dispersion is not atypical; no local deviation can be claimed for this packet.
