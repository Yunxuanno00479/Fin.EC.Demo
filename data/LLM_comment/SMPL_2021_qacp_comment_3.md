## Change Point at Transcript Unavailable (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition** (no Change Point packets were detected in Q&A; hence no identifiable tracked inflection at any transcript second).
- One-sentence tracked-departure explanation (excerpt-based): **Unavailable** in provided data because **no Q&A Change Point packets and no excerpt evidence** were supplied; therefore, no departure from the prior narrative trajectory can be anchored to a transcript position.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable.**
- Justification: **Unavailable in provided data** (no Change Point packet excerpts and no numeric cue context at any identified inflection point within Q&A).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable.**
- Interpret (Accumulated Communication): With **no detected Q&A change points across all dimensions**, the packet-level evidence for **steepening/flattening** in cumulative tone is **Unavailable**; the most defensible characterization from the provided context is **stable interaction dynamics** (as noted) rather than a dimension-specific intensity shift.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (no local evidence or deviation-table blocks were provided for any Q&A Change Point packet; additionally, no change points were detected to anchor a local window).
- Session-baseline-only discussion (Pre-Market context): In the **Pre-Market** session, baseline liquidity is typically limited; here, the panel baseline shows **Trade_Count consistently 1 per bin** (std 0) with **Trade_Volume** ranging **1–50 shares** (mean **21.2**), and **Bid_Ask_Spread** ranging **0.022–2.0** (mean **0.273**, dispersion material). **Order_Book_Imbalance** spans **-1 to 0.714**, consistent with potentially asymmetric displayed depth in low-liquidity conditions; **Quote_Revision_Frequency** is modest (**1–2**). Without local evidence, no local-versus-baseline deviations can be stated.
