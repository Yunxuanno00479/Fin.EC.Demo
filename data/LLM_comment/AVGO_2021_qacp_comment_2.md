## Change Point at Transcript Unavailable (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No (Unavailable: no Change Point packets provided).**
- If No: **procedural transition** (i.e., *no detected structural break to classify from packet-level excerpts*).
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  **Unavailable — no packet excerpts or timestamps were provided, and the data context states no Q&A change points were detected across all dimensions.**

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable.**
- Justification: **Unavailable in provided data** (no numeric cue at a detected inflection and no excerpt evidence because no Change Point packets are present).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable.**
- Interpret: **Unavailable — with no detected Q&A change points and no packet-level slope proxies, dimension-specific steepening/flattening of cumulative tone cannot be assessed from the provided materials.**

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- **Local Market Evidence Status: Unavailable** — no Change Point packets imply no local windows, no local evidence block, and no deviation-table highlights tied to transcript seconds.
- Session baseline only (After-Hours context):  
  - In **After-Hours**, liquidity is typically thinner and response metrics (e.g., spreads, quote revisions, trades/volume) can be meaningful even at low absolute levels relative to baseline; wider spreads are also expected.  
  - Provided baseline indicates: **Bid-Ask Spread mean 1.0015 (range 0.003–2.0)**; **Order Book Imbalance mean -0.6665 (range -1 to -0.333)**; **Quote Revision Frequency mean 3 (range 1–9)**; **Trade Count mean 1.85 (range 1–21)**; **Trade Volume mean 137 shares (range 1–2,116)**.  
  - Without local evidence tied to transcript seconds, only this session-level dispersion can be reported, and no localized co-movement with Q&A interaction dynamics can be evaluated.
