### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **procedural transition**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The narrative departs from the handoff/introduction sequence (“**Good morning, everyone.**”) into a slide-directed prepared remarks segment (“**Please advance to slide three.**”), marking a new organizational frame for subsequent content.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The after-window immediately introduces a numeric operational scale cue (“**more than 19,000** Plexus team members”), consistent with the packet’s numeric-cue hint shifting from **False→True**.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=4e-05; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening** is observed, consistent with a sharp increase in cumulative tone momentum (Accumulated Communication) as the prepared narrative transitions into denser informational content.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:32:09–08:34:34 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): With **Pre-Market** liquidity typically limited, the baseline shows **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**; **Trade_Count** and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, so no local-vs-baseline comparison is feasible for this packet.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The discourse shifts from social-pillar/team-member development language (“**These groups aid in facilitating our goal that all Plexus team members reach their full potential.**”) to a results-focused segment introduced by slide navigation (“**Please advance to slide five for a discussion of our fiscal fourth quarter results.**”), representing a tracked departure in narrative trajectory.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The after-window immediately discloses performance metrics (“**GAAP EPS of $1.16**” and “**operating margin of 5%**”), aligning with the numeric-cue hint shifting **False→True**.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.0; delta_after=0.97149; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening** indicates a notable increase in accumulation intensity as the narrative moves from qualitative ESG/social discussion to quantitative quarterly results.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:35:40–08:39:05 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): In a **Pre-Market** setting with limited baseline liquidity, the available panel indicates **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**; **Quote_Volatility**, **Trade_Count**, and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, preventing any localized response characterization.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking guidance phrase(s):
  - “**As we look to the first quarter of fiscal 2022**”
  - “**the demand environment remains robust**”
  - “**constraints … continue, limiting our ability to grow revenue in the near term**”
  - “**we are establishing a revenue guidance range of $825 to $865 million**”
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The packet transitions from slide movement (“**Please advance to slide six.**”) into explicitly forward-looking outlook and guidance framing (“**As we look to the first quarter of fiscal 2022…**”), which is a tracked departure from backward-looking operational commentary.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: The numeric cue hint is **False→False**, and the immediate after-excerpt is qualitative guidance/risk framing (“**constraints … continue, limiting our ability to grow revenue in the near term**”), even though later lines in the same window include numeric guidance (e.g., “**$825 to $865 million**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=-0.99995; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation intensity is observed; the packet reflects a directional tonal reversal in the deltas but not an acceleration in cumulative momentum per the provided slope pattern.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:37:35–08:40:28 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): Given **Pre-Market** conditions, the only available baseline indicators are **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**; **Trade_Count** and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, so contemporaneous response alignment cannot be assessed locally.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **risk management pivot**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The narrative shifts from positive demand characterization (“**Customer demand … was very robust**”) to constraint-and-disruption framing (“**global supply chain constraints… were worse than anticipated**”), representing a tracked pivot toward downside contextualization.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The numeric cue hint shifts **True→False**, and the after-excerpt emphasizes qualitative operational conditions (“**constraints… were worse than anticipated**”) rather than immediate numeric disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-1.0; delta_after=-1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation intensity is indicated, with no steepening in cumulative tone momentum across the change point.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:41:01–08:43:38 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): Under **Pre-Market** limited liquidity, the baseline panel reports **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**; **Quote_Volatility**, **Trade_Count**, and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, so local response dispersion cannot be evaluated.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **metric disclosure**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The tracked departure is from a program-count/annualized-revenue statement (“**38 new manufacturing programs… $251 million**”) to a fiscal-year aggregate record (“**wins total exceeded $1 billion**”), shifting the narrative emphasis to a headline summary metric.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard**.
- Justification: Numeric cue hint remains **True→True**, and both sides contain explicit quantities (“**38**”, “**$251 million**” before; “**exceeded $1 billion**” after).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation intensity is observed, consistent with continued metric-heavy disclosure without an indicated acceleration in cumulative tone momentum.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:43:16–08:45:55 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): With **Pre-Market** liquidity constraints, the session baseline provides **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**, while **Trade_Count** and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, limiting any inference about contemporaneous microstructure alignment.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **risk management pivot**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The packet moves from a general characterization of supply-chain difficulty (“**challenging supply chain environment**”) to a more specific operational constraint mechanism (“**Extended component lead times… procure inventory earlier**”), tracking a pivot into operational risk/process implications.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Numeric cue hint is **False→False**, and both excerpts are qualitative/operational (“**challenging supply chain environment**”; “**Extended component lead times…**”), without immediate numeric disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.99571; delta_after=-0.97884; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation intensity is indicated by the slope pattern, despite a sign change in the deltas; the cumulative-tone momentum is not described as steepening.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows were found within the local window (08:55:03–08:57:42 ET)**.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): In **Pre-Market** conditions where liquidity is typically limited, the available baseline shows **Bid-Ask Spread mean 0.982** and **Quote Revision Frequency mean 1**; **Quote_Volatility**, **Trade_Count**, and **Trade_Volume** are **Unavailable in provided data**, precluding any packet-level local response comparison.
