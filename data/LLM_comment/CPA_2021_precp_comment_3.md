### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition.**
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The narrative departs from the prior risk-and-disclaimer framing into a speaker handoff and opening remarks—“**Now, I’d like to turn the call over to our CEO** …” → “**Thank you, Daniel**”—which is tracked as a structural reset in presentation flow rather than a content shift.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False, and the excerpt evidence is ceremonial/introductory (“**Thank you, Daniel**”), with no quantitative disclosure in the immediate after-excerpt.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.0028; delta_after = 0.11413; slope_pattern = Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: The cumulative tone trajectory exhibits **steepening**, consistent with a shift toward higher-intensity communication at the onset of the CEO’s prepared remarks (Accumulated Communication increases more rapidly after the packet boundary).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 44** within the 11:01:00–11:03:45 ET window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +14.1667**, indicating higher quote-update activity locally relative to the Regular-session baseline.
- Session context (Regular): In **Regular trading hours**, baseline activity is typically higher and more variable; accordingly, the local elevation in quote revisions is best interpreted as **above-baseline dispersion in quoting activity** temporally aligned with the speaker transition, rather than as an unusually large absolute level by itself.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **metric disclosure.**
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The discourse moves from acknowledgements (“**acknowledging our great COPPA team**…”) to an explicitly results-oriented setup (“**I will start by going over our third quarter results**”), which is tracked because it marks the onset of systematic performance reporting relative to the preceding ceremonial narrative.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=True, and the subsequent content immediately transitions into quantitative metrics (“**Our capacity came in at 4.4 billion available seat miles… 69%… of 2019**”), consistent with hard-information disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.00005; delta_after = 0.0; slope_pattern = Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: The cumulative tone shows **flattening**, indicating **stable/level Accumulated Communication intensity** at the packet boundary even as the content transitions into numerically anchored performance discussion.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 39** within the 11:07:11–11:09:48 ET window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +68.2303** shares (and **Trade_Volume_M = +0.0000682303**), indicating locally higher traded volume relative to the Regular-session baseline, despite other microstructure measures being near-to-slightly below baseline on average.
- Session context (Regular): During **Regular hours**, moderate volume deviations can be informative but should be contextualized against the higher baseline and dispersion; here, the local window is characterized by **volume above baseline alongside roughly baseline-like quote revision frequency** (deviation = -0.3333), consistent with a mixed microstructure response profile temporally aligned with the transition into results metrics.
