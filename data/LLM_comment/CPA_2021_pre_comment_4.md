## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–~880 seconds)

- Formal opening and housekeeping, including IFRS basis, non-IFRS metrics, and forward‑looking statement disclaimers.
- CEO emphasizes a strong Q4 2021 recovery: higher capacity vs. 2020, improved unit revenues and costs, and the best operating performance since the start of the pandemic.
- Highlight of full‑year 2021 turnaround: return to adjusted profitability, fleet simplification to an all‑737 platform, reactivation and expansion of the network, and repeated recognition for on‑time performance.
- Balanced discussion of near‑term headwinds: Omicron‑related demand softness, crew shortages, flight cancellations, and expected lower Q1 2022 load factors and unit revenues.
- Reaffirmation of the business model: cost discipline, hub‑and‑spoke strength in intra‑Latin America, liquidity and balance sheet resilience, and ongoing capacity growth.
- CFO provides detailed Q4 and full‑year metrics (revenues, margins, unit costs, cargo strength, liquidity, fleet evolution) and a cautious Q1 2022 guidance with limited full‑year visibility.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Early minutes (0–~130 seconds) are mostly neutral/technical (operator and IR logistics, IFRS/non‑IFRS, risk disclosures), keeping cumulative tone low and slightly volatile around zero.
- Around 130–420 seconds, with the CEO’s overview of Q4 and full‑year 2021, the slope of cumulative tone steepens sharply upward (multiple sentences with very high positive tone scores), indicating a concentrated injection of upbeat information about performance, costs, network, and operational accolades.
- Between ~420–470 seconds, there is a notable downward inflection: negative tone around Omicron, crew constraints, flight cancellations, and softer Q1 demand flattens and partially reverses the previously steep positive momentum.
- From ~490 seconds onward, the slope turns positive again, though more moderately: reaffirmation of the business model, followed by the CFO’s detailed but more neutral guidance and balance sheet discussion, adds incremental positive tone without the earlier surge intensity.
- Overall, the Presentation shows a strongly positive net cumulative tone by ~880 seconds, with two visible structural shifts where negative pandemic‑related remarks and then later reaffirmation/guidance adjust the trajectory rather than leaving it monotonic.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

Context:  
- Regular session baseline features relatively high underlying trading and quoting activity, with meaningful dispersion in spreads, quote revisions, and volumes across the day.
- The Presentation window (approximately 10:59:06–11:16:38 ET) overlaps active market hours, so deviations from baseline should be interpreted against an already elevated liquidity environment.

**Bid‑Ask Spread**

- Local mean spread is slightly lower than the session mean (difference ≈ −0.09), with similar dispersion (std ≈ 0.66 locally vs. 0.67 baseline).
- During the Presentation, spreads remain within the typical intraday range (local median 0.004, same as baseline median), suggesting no unusual widening or tightening relative to the broader session.
- Given Regular session conditions, this pattern is consistent with spreads behaving in line with normal intra‑day variability.

**Order Book Imbalance**

- Local mean imbalance is modestly more positive than baseline (difference ≈ +0.06), with comparable dispersion.
- Imbalance spans the full range [−1, 1] both locally and in the session, indicating that buy/sell pressure oscillations during the Presentation are typical in magnitude, albeit slightly tilted toward the buy side on average.
- In a Regular session, such a moderate shift sits comfortably within normal microstructure fluctuations rather than standing out as extreme.

**Quote Revision Frequency**

- Local mean quote revision frequency is higher than baseline by about 7.2 updates per bin (local mean ≈ 41.8 vs. 34.6), with a local maximum of 83, well above the baseline mean and close to the session upper range.
- This indicates that the Presentation window co‑occurs with elevated quote updating intensity relative to the broader day, consistent with heightened information processing or attention while the call unfolds.
- In a Regular session context, this uplift is noticeable but still within the observed session maxima, implying more active quote adjustment rather than an outlier regime.

**Quote Volatility**

- Local quote volatility is higher than the baseline mean by about 3.6 units (local ≈ 22.9 vs. 19.4), with similar dispersion and overlapping ranges.
- This suggests somewhat more pronounced short‑horizon price adjustments during the Presentation, but still within the typical volatility band of the trading day.
- For a Regular session, this appears as a moderate intensification of usual intra‑day volatility rather than a distinct regime shift.

**Trades and Volumes**

- Trade count per bin is essentially aligned with baseline (difference ≈ +0.01; local mean ≈ 4.37 vs. 4.35), with a similar range from 1 to around 30 trades.
- Average trade volume per bin is somewhat lower than the session mean (difference ≈ −110 shares), and the local maximum (10,000 shares) is below the session maximum (25,506 shares), though both share comparable dispersion.
- Given the higher overall liquidity of the Regular session, these patterns indicate that the Presentation aligns with typical trading intensity and size, with no marked local surge or contraction in executed volume relative to the rest of the day.

**Summary of Local Responses**

- During the Presentation, market microstructure indicators are broadly consistent with Regular session norms in spreads, imbalance, trade counts, and volumes.
- The main distinguishing feature is a higher quote revision frequency and somewhat higher quote volatility, which are temporally aligned with the earnings communication but remain within the range of regular intraday variation.
