## Change Point at Transcript 1170.046s

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Procedural transition.**
- One-sentence tracked-departure explanation (excerpt-based): The packet marks a handoff from the prior speaker’s closing (“**With that, I will turn the call over to Bruce.**”) into the CEO’s opening remarks and acknowledgments (“**Thank you, David.**” / “**On behalf of the management team, we offer Rick our deep appreciation for your leadership.**”), representing a clear transition in narrative role and discourse function rather than forward guidance.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: The numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the excerpts are predominantly ceremonial/relational content (“**Thank you, David.**”; “**deep appreciation**”), with no contemporaneous quantitative disclosure in the immediate before/after excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.04737; delta_after=0.99991; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret (Accumulated Communication): The steepening pattern is consistent with a **higher intensity** of accumulated tone momentum immediately after the transition, temporally aligned with the CEO’s emphatic appreciation/recognition statements.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within local window [2021-11-18 09:18:26.752000 , 2021-11-18 09:21:30.450000].**
  - Deviation-table status: **Unavailable (local window missing).**
- Session baseline context only (Pre-Market): In the **Pre-Market** session, liquidity is typically limited and baselines are correspondingly low; the provided panel indicates median **Trade_Count = 1** and median **Trade_Volume = 19 shares** per bin, alongside a wide dispersion in **Bid_Ask_Spread** (range **-2 to 2**, reported as dispersion only). Given the lack of local observations around 1170.046s, no transcript-timed co-occurrence with quotes/trades can be assessed beyond these baseline characteristics.
