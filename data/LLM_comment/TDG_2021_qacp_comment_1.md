## Change Point at Transcript 2181.643s (and Dimension assertive)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- One-sentence tracking rationale (with excerpts): The dialogue shifts from a concluded cash-flow check (“**nothing significant**… **interest expense**… **down to $1.07 billion**”) to a new operating focus on commercial OEM conditions (“**switch to the OE**… **expected reduced commercial OE through fiscal year 21**”), representing a discrete departure from the prior cash-flow/financing narrative.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: The pre-change answer is largely qualitative (“**nothing significant other than what we already discussed**”), whereas the post-change question introduces explicitly structured, time-bounded operating references (“**through fiscal year 21**”) and mechanism-oriented components (“**booking**,” “**destocking cadence**,” “**step down in wide-body rates**”), consistent with **After_has_numeric_cue=True**.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.085; delta_after = 0.331; slope_pattern = Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret (dimension-specific): For the **assertive** dimension, the larger post-change increment indicates **steepening accumulated communication intensity**, consistent with a higher-momentum, more declarative transition into OEM/build-rate framing (“**in line with build rates**… **significant uptick in orders**”).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available** (11:33:43–11:41:44 ET).
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency reaches a local maximum of 118** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +18.2665**, indicating locally elevated quote updating relative to the regular-session baseline.
- Regular-session context: Because this occurs in **Regular** trading hours (higher baseline activity), the reported deviations should be interpreted relative to a naturally more liquid and variable environment; in this packet, the local window is nonetheless observed alongside **higher quote revision frequency** and **higher trade volume vs baseline** (Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = **+13.2004**), while **bid-ask spread dispersion** is also higher relative to baseline (Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = **+0.219862**, reported as deviation without interpreting sign).
