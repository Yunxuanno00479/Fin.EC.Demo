## Change Point at Transcript Unavailable (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No (Unavailable)**.
- If Yes: **Unavailable**.
- If No: **No change point packet is provided; classification is Unavailable** (no basis to assign {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure} from excerpts).
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts: **Unavailable in provided data (no Q&A change point packets and no excerpts were provided).**

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable**.
- Justification: **Unavailable in provided data (no numeric cue, excerpt evidence, or packet-level fields for comparison).**

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable**.
- Interpret: **Unavailable in provided data; no dimension-level change point packets exist from which to infer steepening/flattening/stability in cumulative tone.**

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- **Local Market Evidence Status: Unavailable** — Reason: **No change point packets were detected in Q&A, and no local evidence / local-vs-baseline deviation blocks were provided for any transcript second.**
- Session baseline context (After-Hours):  
  - After-hours liquidity is typically limited; even low trade counts/volumes can be meaningful relative to baseline, and wider bid–ask spreads are expected.  
  - Baseline summary (panel): mean **Bid_Ask_Spread 0.0559** (range **0.017–0.108**), mean **Order_Book_Imbalance -0.391** (range **-0.941–0.538**), **Trade_Count mean 1.71** (max **7**), **Trade_Volume mean 320 shares** (max **2000**), and **Quote_Revision_Frequency** observed around **1–2** when available.
