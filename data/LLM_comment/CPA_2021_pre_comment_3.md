### 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation)

- The call opens with standard procedural remarks and detailed legal / non-IFRS disclaimers, setting a cautious formal framework around forward-looking content and risk disclosures (around 100–130 seconds).
- Management emphasizes a strong operational and financial recovery: improved Q3 results, restored capacity to roughly 70% of 2019 levels, higher load factors, and a return to operating profitability with double-digit margins (roughly 150–320 seconds and revisited by the CFO after 480 seconds).
- A repeatedly positive narrative is built around demand recovery in Latin America supported by vaccination progress and easing travel restrictions, with capacity and network expansion framed as a disciplined response to that environment (approximately 165–210 and 362–383 seconds).
- The CEO highlights operational excellence and corporate strengths—low unit costs, high on-time performance, and a “world-class” product—as core elements of a “proven and strong business model” and competitive hub position in Latin America (roughly 337–447 seconds).
- Fleet and network strategy are described in detail, including accelerated delivery of 737 MAX 9 aircraft, fleet simplification, reactivation of stored aircraft, and new destinations, positioning the company for post-pandemic growth (about 362–421 and 647–671 seconds).
- The CFO provides a granular financial breakdown: net and operating profits (reported vs. adjusted), unit costs and yields, liquidity and credit facilities, and a cautious but constructive outlook for Q4 2021 and early-2022 capacity, while underscoring residual uncertainty that constrains full-year 2022 guidance (approximately 500–722 seconds).

### 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Early moderator remarks (0–40 seconds) are near-neutral, with cumulative tone hovering close to zero and briefly dipping slightly negative.
- The introduction by Investor Relations (roughly 40–130 seconds) shows modest positive tone but includes a sizeable negative inflection around the formal risk/forward-looking statements disclosure (around 117 seconds), pushing cumulative tone back near neutral to slightly negative.
- A sharp structural shift in tone occurs when the CEO begins (around 131 seconds): cumulative tone jumps from slightly negative to clearly positive, then steepens markedly between about 136 and 210 seconds as management emphasizes employee appreciation, improved financials, strong demand, and capacity recovery. This segment reflects a phase of intense positive information injection.
- Subsequent discussion of operational and financial highlights (roughly 220–350 seconds) maintains a high positive level but with more moderate slope: occasional negative sentences (COVID-related risks, cost/yield remarks) partially offset strongly positive statements on profits, cash, and performance metrics.
- The network, fleet, and strategic-positioning narrative (approximately 362–455 seconds) re-accelerates positive cumulative tone, with extended strings of highly positive sentences about new destinations, complete network recovery, and strategic advantages.
- The CFO section (roughly 461–736 seconds) sustains a broadly positive cumulative tone with a gently rising but more balanced slope: positive contributions from profitability, liquidity, cost control, and Q4 outlook are tempered by negative tone around yield pressure, mark‑to‑market losses, higher fuel prices, and guidance uncertainty. Overall, the slope remains positive but somewhat flatter than during the CEO’s early remarks, indicating a transition from highly promotional to more measured informational content.

### 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

**Context:**  
- Regular-session trading provides a relatively high-activity baseline. Deviations in quotes/trades during the Presentation should be interpreted relative to this higher-liquidity environment, with attention to changes in intensity and dispersion rather than absolute levels.

**Quotes and Order Book**

- **Bid–Ask Spread**
  - Local mean spread is slightly lower than the session mean (0.014 vs 0.024 USD; deviation ≈ −0.010).
  - In a Regular session where median spreads are 0.005 and dispersion is high, this suggests spreads during the Presentation are broadly in line with, if not marginally tighter than, typical intraday conditions.
  - The wide range (from negative values up to 2) indicates considerable dispersion, but this is similar to the session-wide profile; no clear widening is observed alongside the Presentation.

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean imbalance is modestly less negative than baseline (−0.036 vs −0.083; deviation ≈ +0.046).
  - This points to a somewhat more balanced order book (less skew toward one side) during the Presentation relative to the broader Regular-session average, although values remain near neutral (median ≈ 0).

- **Quote Dynamics (Frequency and Volatility)**
  - **Quote Revision Frequency** is higher locally (mean ≈ 33.6 vs 25.3; deviation ≈ +8.3), with a local maximum equal to the session maximum (109) at the start of the call.
  - **Quote Volatility** is lower on average during the Presentation (7.6 vs 12.1; deviation ≈ −4.5), with a similar maximum (≈24) but reduced typical levels.
  - In a Regular session, this pattern suggests that the Presentation co-occurs with more active quote updating but, on average, smaller price displacements per bin than the broader day. This combination is consistent with intensified order-book maintenance rather than elevated intraday price turbulence.

**Trades and Volumes**

- **Trade Count**
  - Local mean trade count is somewhat higher than baseline (4.45 vs 3.81; deviation ≈ +0.64), with comparable dispersion.
  - Given Regular-session conditions, this represents a modest uptick in trade frequency during the Presentation, but not an extreme outlier relative to the wide session distribution (std ≈ 7.7; maximum 63).

- **Trade Volume**
  - Local mean trade volume is higher (336 vs 256 shares; deviation ≈ +80) with notably larger dispersion (std ≈ 511 vs 431).
  - In the context of a Regular session, this indicates that the Presentation interval is associated with somewhat heavier and more variable trading sizes than the overall intraday average, though peak volumes are aligned with session-wide extremes.

**Overall Interpretation (Regular Session Context)**

- During the Presentation, market responses are characterized by:
  - Slightly **tighter spreads** and **more balanced order flow** relative to the Regular-session mean.
  - **More frequent quote revisions** but **lower average quote volatility**, indicating active but not unusually volatile quoting conditions.
  - **Moderately elevated trade counts and volumes**, consistent with a mild intensification of trading activity rather than a regime shift.
- Taken together, and relative to the high baseline typical of Regular trading, the Presentation segment is associated with **incrementally higher microstructure activity and liquidity engagement**, without clear evidence of pronounced dislocation or stress in spreads or volatility.
