## Change Point at Transcript 2342.861s (and Dimension cautious)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**If and when that subsides or trends the other way, I mean, we should benefit from a margin perspective as long as volumes stay up**”
  - “**we would expect that to continue**”
  - “**we think that there’s also growth opportunities**… “**where we think that the U.S. market will ultimately go**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The exchange shifts from a near-term ceiling/constraints framing (“what would keep this year’s margin from not going higher… structurally”) toward conditional forward-looking positioning and longer-horizon demand/product-line opportunity language anchored in inflation regimes and energy-efficiency adoption.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False; the content remains predominantly qualitative, emphasizing conditional scenarios and expectations (“If and when that subsides… we should benefit,” “we would expect that to continue,” “growth opportunities”) rather than introducing new point estimates or quantified targets.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.074; delta_after=-0.062; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  For the **cautious** dimension, the cumulative tone continues to drift downward at a broadly similar rate, with a modest flattening (less negative delta after), indicating **stable accumulated communication intensity** with slightly reduced incremental caution in the immediate post-change-point narrative.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=34** (within the 11:31:32–11:43:32 ET window).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +4.33333** (higher local quote-update activity than the session baseline).
- Market Session context (Regular):  
  In **Regular** trading hours, baseline quoting/trading activity is structurally higher and more dispersed; the observed **above-baseline quote revision frequency** and the accompanying positive deviations (e.g., **Trade_Volume +59.535 shares**, **Trade_Count +0.520679**) are best interpreted as **modest local elevations relative to an already active, variable session baseline**, rather than as unusually large absolute levels. Additionally, **Bid_Ask_Spread** contains negative values in the local window (range **-2 to 2**), so interpretation is limited to **dispersion/range**, not sign.
