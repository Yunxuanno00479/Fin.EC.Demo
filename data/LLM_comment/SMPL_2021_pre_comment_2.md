### 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation)

- Management frames the quarter as broadly in line with expectations, with modest net sales growth (1.5%) and higher adjusted EBITDA supported by cost controls and Quest acquisition synergies.  
- Strong emphasis on “snackier” at-home products (confections, chips, cookies) and e‑commerce across both Atkins and Quest, contrasted with temporarily softer on-the-go formats (bars and shakes) linked to reduced mobility.  
- Atkins is described as outperforming a soft weight management segment, with improving buyer trends and expectations that rising mobility and easier year-ago comparisons will support a return toward pre‑COVID growth dynamics.  
- Quest is positioned as the main growth engine, with double‑digit retail takeaway, outperformance versus its active nutrition segment, and particularly strong gains in e‑commerce and newer forms (chips, cookies, confections).  
- Management highlights integration and synergy realization (Quest, divested/ceased businesses), noting a slightly lower gross margin driven by mix and higher in-store merchandising, with an eye on emerging input cost inflation into fiscal 2022.  
- Forward-looking commentary stresses sustained marketing investment in the core business, increased in-store merchandising, and expectations of solid second-half growth as shopper traffic and category trends improve.

### 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- The cumulative tone starts slightly negative during the operator’s scripted remarks (around 0–25 seconds), then turns positive and rises steadily once management begins speaking.  
- From roughly 30 seconds through about 650 seconds, the slope is predominantly upward, with repeated sharp positive increments around key performance claims (e.g., net sales growth, adjusted EBITDA gains, market share gains, Quest and e‑commerce outperformance).  
- Negative inflections appear around discussions of headwinds—softness in bars and shakes, weight management segment declines, gross margin compression, inflationary pressures, divestiture and European exit headwinds—temporarily flattening or modestly pulling down the trajectory.  
- Overall, the section exhibits a clearly **steepening positive** cumulative tone profile, indicative of sustained, high-intensity information injection with an optimistic tilt, punctuated by brief recalibrations when management acknowledges structural or temporary pressures.  
- Change point flags within the presentation are sparse; where they appear (e.g., around 360 and 674 seconds), they coincide with transitions in topic (Atkins performance dynamics, handoff to the CFO) rather than a wholesale reversal of tone, and are embedded in the broader upward trend.

### 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Pre-Market Context)

**Context:**  
- Pre-Market trading typically has limited liquidity; even small absolute changes in spreads, quote revisions, or volume can be informative relative to this lower baseline.

**Bid–Ask Spread & Order Book**

- Local mean Bid_Ask_Spread is slightly more negative than the Pre-Market baseline mean (difference ≈ −0.04, with a wide local dispersion). Given that the baseline already exhibits wide and sometimes negative values, this suggests:
  - No clear tightening relative to typical Pre-Market conditions.
  - Spreads remain in a range consistent with low-liquidity, pre-open trading, with occasional wider observations.  
- Order_Book_Imbalance is modestly higher locally than baseline (difference ≈ +0.15), with local values ranging from balanced (0) to fully one-sided (1). In a Pre-Market setting, this indicates:
  - Slightly more directional order-book skew than average, but within a range still compatible with thin order books and intermittent depth.

**Quote Activity and Volatility**

- Local Quote_Revision_Frequency is materially lower than the session baseline (local mean 2.25 vs. baseline mean 15.64; deviation ≈ −13.39).  
  - Local peak frequency (4) is well below the baseline’s upper range (max 94), implying fewer quote updates in the window around the presentation.  
- Quote_Volatility is also lower than baseline (difference ≈ −1.16), with local values clustered in the mid range of the Pre-Market distribution.  
  - Combined, this suggests relatively **muted quote dynamics** during the presentation phase, even acknowledging that Pre-Market baseline activity is already limited.

**Trading Intensity (Trades and Volume)**

- Trade_Count and Trade_Volume are both lower locally than the Pre-Market baseline (deviations ≈ −1.86 trades per bin and −511 shares per bin, respectively).  
  - Local medians (1 trade, ~65 shares) are small even by Pre-Market standards, and dispersion is narrow.  
- In the context of typically thin Pre-Market liquidity, these figures indicate **subdued trade engagement** during the presentation window, with no clear clustering of heightened activity around the identified change points or around the steepest positive tone increments.

**Overall Interpretation for the Presentation Phase**

- During the management presentation, local microstructure indicators—spreads, quote revisions, volatility, and trading intensity—are all at or below their already low Pre-Market baselines.  
- Relative to session norms, the presentation co-occurs with:
  - Stable-to-slightly more imbalanced order books,  
  - Fewer quote updates and lower volatility, and  
  - Reduced trading counts and volumes.  
- Within the constraints of limited Pre-Market liquidity, this pattern is consistent with a phase where substantial positive informational content (as reflected in the steepening cumulative tone) is **not** accompanied by an outsized contemporaneous deviation in observable trading or quoting activity.
