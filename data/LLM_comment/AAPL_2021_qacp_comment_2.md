## Change Point at Transcript 2153.044s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The question sequence moves from sustainability/normalisation framing (“**sustainability of current demand trends**… as you lap… COVID… later this year”) to a distinct services monetisation topic focusing on pricing and content (“**how you're thinking about pricing**… and… uptake of TV Plus paid subs”).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **no numeric cue** in both segments (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False), and the shift is primarily qualitative—from broad demand sustainability language to qualitative pricing strategy inquiry (“**how you're thinking about pricing**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.088; delta_after=0.632; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening** in the optimistic cumulative tone proxy indicates **increasing accumulated communication intensity** at this point in the Q&A, consistent with a more positively framed interaction immediately after the tracked topic boundary.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=2777** (local peak check).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +396.526**, indicating higher quote update activity locally relative to the session baseline.
- After-Hours context: Given **after-hours** trading conditions (lower liquidity baseline and typically wider spreads), the observed elevation in quote revision activity and higher trade activity deviations should be interpreted relative to the thinner baseline typical of this session, rather than against regular-hours norms; dispersion in Bid_Ask_Spread is also expected after-hours (with negatives present, only the range/dispersion is reportable).

## Change Point at Transcript 2153.044s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet marks a transition from a broad, uncertainty-tinged sustainability prompt (“**sustainability of current demand trends**… as the world normalizes”) to a different line of questioning centred on services pricing and subscription disclosure requests (“**how you're thinking about pricing**… share any stats… TV Plus paid subs”).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint shows **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the excerpted pivot is qualitative (pricing philosophy and request for “stats” without embedded figures in the prompt), supporting a soft-information to soft-information transition.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.872; delta_after=0.702; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: The **stable** slope pattern in the specific cumulative tone proxy suggests **broadly unchanged accumulated communication intensity** around this boundary, indicating that while the topic changes, the specificity-related accumulation does not meaningfully accelerate at the change point.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=2777** (local peak check).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Count local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +30.0315** (with Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = **+1954.07** shares also elevated), indicating higher local trade activity relative to baseline.
- After-Hours context: In an **after-hours** setting, even moderate absolute increases in trading and quoting metrics can be meaningful relative to a limited-liquidity baseline; spreads commonly exhibit wider dispersion after-hours, so local deviations are best viewed as session-relative co-movements rather than regular-hours scale comparisons.
