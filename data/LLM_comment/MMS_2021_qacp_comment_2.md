## Change Point at Transcript 2828.332s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- This change point is tracked because the interaction moves from a forward-looking operating ramp discussion (“**fiscal 22**… **full run rate**… **margin**”) to a distinct corporate-finance priority question (“**capital allocation**… **deleveraging**… **EBITDA grow into it**”), representing a clear departure from the prior program-execution narrative.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The pre-change prompt contains explicit numeric framing (“**fiscal 22**… **year, two years, three years**… **full run rate**”), while the post-change question is predominantly policy/priority-oriented and non-quantified (“**What’s your view on deleveraging?**… **main priority?**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.764; delta_after=0.847; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: For the **specific** dimension, the accumulated communication intensity appears **stable**, with a modestly higher post-change increment, consistent with continued specificity in the dialogue even as the topical focus rotates.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=34** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +1.02392** (higher quote update activity than the session baseline).
- Pre-Market context: Given **limited liquidity baseline** in Pre-Market trading, the observed elevation in quote-revision activity is notable in relative terms; concurrently, **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -115.653** indicates lighter trading volume than baseline, consistent with a quote-adjustment-heavy response profile rather than trade-heavy activity in this session.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- This change point is tracked because the Q&A transitions from a quantification-oriented discussion of program ramp timing (“**fiscal 22**… **hit full run rate and margin**”) to a separate line of inquiry on balance-sheet priorities (“**capital allocation**… **deleveraging**”), indicating a discrete shift in the interaction agenda rather than continuation of the same explanatory thread.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The pre-change content includes numeric/temporal quantification cues (“**fiscal 22**… **year, two years, three years**”), whereas the post-change question is framed as qualitative prioritization without explicit numeric targets (“**main priority?**… **comfortable letting EBITDA grow into it**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.724; delta_after=0.732; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: For the **clear** dimension, accumulation intensity is **stable**, suggesting the interaction remains comparably coherent/structured across the topic change, without evidence of a pronounced step-up or step-down in clarity momentum.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=34** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -115.653** (lower trading volume versus baseline).
- Pre-Market context: In **Pre-Market**, lower absolute trade volume can still be meaningful relative to typical thin liquidity; here, the response pattern is characterized by **relatively higher quote updating** (Quote_Revision_Frequency deviation positive) alongside **below-baseline trading volume**, consistent with a microstructure environment where repricing activity may be expressed more through quotes than through executed volume.


## Change Point at Transcript 2828.332s (and Dimension relevant)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- This change point is tracked because the dialogue shifts from an operating/program ramp quantification prompt (“**fiscal 22**… **full run rate**”) to a capital structure prioritization question (“**deleveraging**… **priority**”), marking a reorientation of what information is being solicited in the interaction rather than continued elaboration on the same subject.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The pre-change prompt embeds numeric/time-horizon cues (“**fiscal 22**… **year, two years, three years**”), while the post-change question is qualitative and preference-based (“**What’s your view on deleveraging?**… **main priority?**”), reducing explicit quantification in the question framing.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.959; delta_after=0.475; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: For the **relevant** dimension, the accumulation intensity **flattens materially**, consistent with a transition in interaction focus where the ongoing “relevance momentum” (as measured by the cumulative tone proxy) consolidates rather than accelerates.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=34** (local peak check).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -0.010527** (reported as a relative shift versus baseline; given potential negatives, interpretation is restricted to dispersion context rather than sign).
- Pre-Market context: With **limited liquidity** typical of Pre-Market conditions, bid-ask spread behavior commonly exhibits wider and more variable dispersion; alongside this, **Quote_Revision_Frequency deviation = +1.02392** indicates comparatively more quote updating than baseline, while trading volume remains **below baseline** (Trade_Volume deviation negative), collectively aligning with a quote-driven adjustment pattern in a thinner session.
