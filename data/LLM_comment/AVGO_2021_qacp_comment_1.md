## Change Point at Transcript 1864.382s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The interaction shifts from an analyst’s detailed probing on *lead-time levels and end-demand visibility* (“*where are they actually sitting today… How do you have any visibility…?*”) to a new question framing around *orders/backlog dynamics into fiscal Q2* (“*as you look into fiscal Q2… wireless orders… come down…*”), constituting a tracked pivot in the Q&A trajectory.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  **Excerpt evidence:** both sides are framed as qualitative inquiries (e.g., “*where are they actually sitting today…?*” and “*are… orders… going to be strong enough…*”) without explicit numeric disclosure in the excerpted prompts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.919; delta_after=0.603; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  The **flattening** in the *specific* cumulative tone indicates **reduced accumulated communication intensity**, consistent with a transition between question sub-threads rather than an escalation in detailed, precision-oriented disclosure.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  **Local evidence is Available.** One local observation is that **Quote_Revision_Frequency reaches a local_max of 23**, indicating a burst of quote updates within the local window. One deviation-table highlight is **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 38.924 shares** (and **Trade_Volume_M = 3.8924e-05**), i.e., locally higher average share volume relative to the session baseline. In an **After-Hours** setting—where liquidity is typically thinner and spreads are expected to be wider—such above-baseline quoting activity and incremental volume are often interpreted as comparatively meaningful relative to the reduced baseline, while still occurring within the broad dispersion characteristic of this session.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The Q&A transitions from scrutiny of *lead-time stretching and verification of end-user consumption* (“*where are they actually sitting today… How do you know… aren’t stockpiling…?*”) to a distinct focus on *orders strength across segments into fiscal Q2* (“*as you look into fiscal Q2… total orders…*”), marking a tracked boundary between two analyst lines of inquiry.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  **Excerpt evidence:** the before/after questions are both qualitative and conditional (e.g., “*how does that maybe vary…?*” and “*I’m wondering if… orders… are going to be strong enough…*”) without explicit numeric anchoring in the excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.912; delta_after=0.884; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  The *clear* cumulative tone remains **stable**, suggesting **little change in accumulated communication intensity** at this transition—consistent with continuity in overall clarity even as the conversation moves to a new question focus.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  **Local evidence is Available.** One local observation is **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max = 23** within the stated window. One deviation-table highlight is **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 0.726405**, indicating locally higher quote-update intensity than the session baseline on average. Given the **After-Hours** context (lower baseline liquidity, wider spreads expected), this above-baseline quote revision activity is notable in relative terms, even if absolute levels remain within the session’s wide variability.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The exchange moves from a challenge-oriented demand-validation probe (“*How do you know the users aren’t stockpiling…?*”) to a separate macro framing about near-term order composition (“*as you look into fiscal Q2… wireless orders… come down…*”), representing a tracked shift in what is treated as decision-relevant within the Q&A flow.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  **Excerpt evidence:** both excerpts are question formulations without embedded numbers, emphasizing qualitative uncertainty and conditional reasoning (e.g., “*How do you actually have any visibility…?*” and “*I’m wondering if… will be up…*”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.972; delta_after=0.97; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  The *relevant* cumulative tone shows a **stable** slope, indicating **no material change in accumulated communication intensity** for relevance at the change point, despite the topical redirection.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  **Local evidence is Available.** One local observation is the **Bid_Ask_Spread range** in the local window reaching up to **2** (with local median **0.009**), reflecting substantial dispersion consistent with after-hours trading conditions. One deviation-table highlight is **Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 0.0213352**, indicating a modestly higher average spread locally versus baseline. In an **After-Hours** session—where wider spreads are expected and liquidity is thinner—this above-baseline spread is best contextualized as a relative widening alongside elevated quote activity, rather than interpreted in isolation.
