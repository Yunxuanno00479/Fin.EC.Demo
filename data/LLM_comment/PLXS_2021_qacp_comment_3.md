## Change Point at Transcript 2399.669s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (with excerpts): The dialogue departs from a margin-level discussion framed around numeric reference points (“**5.5 percent operating margin, 10 percent or so gross margin**”) into an operational working-capital/supply-chain mechanics thread focused on inventory constraints and customer behavior (“**continued constrained market… customers… leery about not having the inventory on hand… working with them on deposits**”), representing a tracked redirection of the Q&A trajectory.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The pre-change excerpt contains explicit numeric cues (“**5.5 percent… 10 percent**”; *Before_has_numeric_cue=True*), whereas the post-change excerpt is primarily qualitative about constraints, lead times, and deposit arrangements (“**continued constrained market… lead times… deposits**”; *After_has_numeric_cue=False*).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.179; delta_after=0.009; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret (dimension-specific): In the **optimistic** cumulative tone, the pronounced flattening indicates a marked reduction in incremental upbeat “tone expected value” accumulation, consistent with lower information-injection intensity as the exchange shifts into operational explanation rather than expansionary outlook language.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**.
  - Reason: **Panel data unavailable (window time unavailable).**
- Baseline-only discussion (Pre-Market context): Session baseline metrics are **Unavailable in provided data**; accordingly, only qualitative pre-market context can be noted—**pre-market liquidity is typically limited**, so even modest quote/trade activity could be meaningful relative to baseline, and wider spreads are commonly observed, but **no packet-level local response statements** can be supported here.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (with excerpts): The exchange pivots from near-term margin-bridge clarification around AMS ramp timing (“**spill into Q4… how much cost is associated**”) to a broader commercial execution/investment discussion about win size and scaling front-end resources (“**step up… six or seven million per win… investing in that front end machine… wins in the future**”), marking a tracked departure in narrative focus from margin mechanics to growth-process commentary.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Both sides of the change point are largely qualitative in the provided before/after excerpts (*Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False*), emphasizing interpretive framing (spillover/tailwinds vs. strategic pursuit of larger wins), rather than reporting new point estimates within the excerpted packets.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.025; delta_after=0.552; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret (dimension-specific): For the **optimistic** cumulative tone, the shift from slightly negative accumulation to a strong positive increment indicates a substantial steepening in accumulated communication intensity, consistent with a more expansion-oriented and opportunity-framed segment (e.g., “**bigger opportunities**,” continued investment) relative to the prior margin-clarification thread.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**.
  - Reason: **Panel data unavailable (window time unavailable).**
- Baseline-only discussion (Pre-Market context): Session baseline metrics are **Unavailable in provided data**; thus, no microstructure deviations can be described. In **pre-market**, baseline liquidity is typically thin and response dispersion can be elevated, but the packet provides **no local evidence** to evaluate whether contemporaneous quotes/trades were unusual.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**we are optimistic about fiscal 2022**”
  - “**It’s shaping up to be a strong growth year**”
  - “**establishing new and higher baseline for our operating margin performance**”
  - “**position us well for strong EPS growth within the fiscal year**”
- One-sentence tracking rationale (with excerpts): The packet transitions from late-stage Q&A on longer-horizon footprint expansion (“**second Thailand facility isn’t out of the question somewhere down the road**”) to a formal closing statement consolidating **forward-looking** FY2022 outlook and performance framing (“**strong growth year… higher baseline… strong EPS growth**”), constituting a tracked shift into summarised guidance.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The before excerpt is qualitative (*Before_has_numeric_cue=False*), while the post-change closing contains more concrete performance constructs and guidance-like framing (*After_has_numeric_cue=True* per packet metadata) alongside outcome-relevant constructs (“**strong growth year… higher baseline… EPS growth**”), indicating movement toward more “harder” informational content in the packet definition.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.053; delta_after=0.224; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret (dimension-specific): In the **specific** cumulative tone, the steepening suggests increased specificity accumulation into the closing remarks, consistent with a higher density of consolidated, outcome-referential statements (growth year, margin baseline, EPS growth) relative to the prior, more exploratory facility-footprint discussion.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**.
  - Reason: **Panel data unavailable (window time unavailable).**
- Baseline-only discussion (Pre-Market context): Session baseline metrics are **Unavailable in provided data**; therefore, no statements can be made about whether this guidance-style closing co-occurred with abnormal pre-market quoting/trading. Given **pre-market’s limited liquidity baseline**, any observed contemporaneous response would need explicit local evidence to interpret, which is not provided here.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary**.
- One-sentence tracking rationale (with excerpts): The conversation shifts from a relevance-dense margin clarification request (“**spill into Q4… build off of this 5%… headwinds… tailwinds**”) to a higher-level discussion of new wins and organisational investment (“**average size of the wins… investing… wins in the future**”), representing a tracked reallocation of attention from near-term margin bridge to strategic growth execution.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: The packet’s before/after excerpts are both qualitative and framing-oriented (*Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False*), with emphasis on interpretive “how to think about” questions rather than new quantified disclosures within the excerpt boundaries.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.437; delta_after=0.971; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret (dimension-specific): For the **relevant** cumulative tone, the steepening indicates a higher rate of accumulated relevance—consistent with the move into broader synthesis about win size, customer-facing investment, and process maturity, which may be perceived as more decision-relevant narrative content within the Q&A flow.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**.
  - Reason: **Panel data unavailable (window time unavailable).**
- Baseline-only discussion (Pre-Market context): Session baseline metrics are **Unavailable in provided data**; thus, the analysis cannot assess whether any quote/trade responses were temporally aligned with this relevance steepening. In **pre-market**, limited depth and intermittent quoting are typical; interpreting any response magnitude requires the missing local/baseline panels.
