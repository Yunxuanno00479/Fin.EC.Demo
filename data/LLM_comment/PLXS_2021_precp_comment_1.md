### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**I’m very excited for Sean to leverage his expertise in furthering Plexus’s investor relations program.**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The packet pivots from describing Sean Harrison’s **prior background** (“previously with Loop Capital and Longbow Research”) to an **intended future role contribution** (“leverage his expertise in furthering… program”), representing a forward-oriented reframing.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **no numeric cues** in either segment (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False), and both excerpts are qualitative personnel/IR statements (e.g., “well-respected sell-side analyst” → “excited… furthering… investor relations program”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.01391; delta_after=0.99999; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: **Steepening**, consistent with a sharper tonal increment immediately after the change point, indicating higher accumulated communication intensity within this packet.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=1** (with the single observed bin reporting QRF=1).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -0.428571**, indicating lower local quote-revision activity relative to the session baseline mean.
- Pre-Market context: With **limited liquidity as the baseline**, even sparse quote updates can be informationally salient; however, the observed local quote-revision activity is **below** the session-average level, and trade/spread measures are **Unavailable in provided data** for this local window.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The narrative switches from **healthcare life sciences second-quarter expectation framing** (“we expect a high single-digit increase…”) to a distinct **aerospace and defense performance update** (“Revenue in our aerospace and defense sector was down 6%…”), indicating a sector-level topic transition.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint flags **no numeric cues** on both sides (False/False) for the specified excerpts, and the transition is framed as qualitative expectation versus qualitative evaluation language (“meaningfully short of our expectations”) in the excerpt pair provided.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-1.0; delta_after=-1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable**, indicating comparable accumulated communication intensity immediately before and after the change point within this packet.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within the specified local window** (08:42:01–08:44:47 ET).
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market): Liquidity is typically **thin**; baseline indicates Quote_Revision_Frequency mean **1.42857** (range **1–4**) and Trade_Count mean **1.8** (range **1–5**), so dispersion in quotes/trades is expected even absent local observations in the provided window.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The speaker moves from sector outlook commentary to slide navigation (“**Please advance to slide eight**…”) and then into a new results block (wins), marking a procedural boundary separating content modules.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint changes from **Before_has_numeric_cue=False** to **After_has_numeric_cue=True**, and the subsequent disclosure is explicitly quantitative: “**We won 35 new manufacturing programs… $223 million in annualized revenue**…”

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.00029; delta_after=0.37473; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: **Steepening**, consistent with increased accumulated communication intensity coincident with the shift into quantified wins disclosure.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within the specified local window** (08:42:38–08:45:31 ET).
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market): Given **limited liquidity baseline**, the panel reports Bid_Ask_Spread mean **0.128889** (range **0.048–0.302**) and Quote_Revision_Frequency mean **1.42857** (range **1–4**); without local prints, only baseline dispersion can be referenced and no localized co-movements can be asserted.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The discourse shifts from forward-looking process confidence (“adjustments… will continue… will support…”) to a slide-navigation cue (“**Please advance to slide 11**…”) and then into concrete examples of wins, indicating a procedural segmentation into detail enumeration.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=True** and **After_has_numeric_cue=False**; the “after” excerpt is descriptive and categorical rather than numeric (“**a Class III medical device… treatment of coronary heart disease**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.34962; delta_after=-3e-05; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening**, indicating reduced incremental tonal accumulation and a stabilization pattern consistent with procedural movement into illustrative (less numerically dense) detail.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within the specified local window** (08:45:26–08:48:14 ET).
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market): Baseline Trade_Volume mean is **146.6 shares** (range **5–500**) with Trade_Count mean **1.8** (range **1–5**), consistent with thin pre-market activity; absent local observations, no transcript-timed deviations can be discussed.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The packet transitions from describing closed aftermarket opportunities to directing the audience to a new slide (“**proceed to slide 12**…”) that introduces funnel highlights, indicating a structured presentation boundary.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint moves from **Before_has_numeric_cue=False** to **After_has_numeric_cue=True**, with the subsequent funnel discussion immediately introducing quantified expansion (“**$574 million**…”, “**21% growth**…”, “almost **$3.3 billion**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.02001; delta_after=0.00159; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening**, indicating a modest reduction in incremental tonal accumulation at the transition, despite the nearby introduction of numeric funnel metrics.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within the specified local window** (08:47:11–08:49:50 ET).
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market): With a **limited-liquidity baseline**, spreads and quote revisions show variability (Bid_Ask_Spread range **0.048–0.302**; Quote_Revision_Frequency range **1–4**); without local data, any alignment between this procedural shift and microstructure conditions is **Unavailable in provided data**.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Metric disclosure.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The narrative moves from a general cash-flow framing (“investments in working capital”) into a denser block of quantified capital allocation and cash-flow metrics (e.g., cash from operations, capex, free cash flow; then share repurchase amounts), representing a step-up in disclosed financial detail.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint changes from **Before_has_numeric_cue=False** to **After_has_numeric_cue=True**, and the “after” excerpt is explicitly numeric: “**307,000 shares… $22.8 million… $74.16 per share**” (with additional nearby numeric cash-flow components in the window).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.99999; delta_after=-0.0; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening**, reflecting a reduced rate of cumulative tone change immediately after the inflection, even as the content becomes more quantitatively specific.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable.**
  - Reason: **No market rows found within the specified local window** (08:52:19–08:55:28 ET).
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market): In a setting with **limited liquidity baseline**, observed baseline Trade_Count spans **1–5** and Trade_Volume spans **5–500 shares**, while Bid_Ask_Spread spans **0.048–0.302**; without local evidence, transcript-timed deviations around the metric disclosure are **Unavailable in provided data**.
