### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**Guidance for the remaining half of fiscal 2021** is complicated by four factors.”
  - “the nature and longevity of COVID response work that we have been winning and performing.”
- If No: **Unavailable.**
- This packet is tracked because the speaker transitions from balance-sheet/cash-flow capacity statements into an explicitly structured **guidance complication framework** (“four factors”), marking a departure toward conditional forward-looking qualifiers.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=True** and **After_has_numeric_cue=False**, consistent with moving away from quantification (e.g., “maintain our leverage ratio below **2.5 times**”) toward qualitatively framed uncertainty drivers (“**nature and longevity** of COVID response work”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.0496; delta_after = -0.00005; slope_pattern = Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening** indicates a moderation in accumulated tone momentum, consistent with a shift into a procedural enumeration of factors rather than a continued intensification of evaluative language.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows** were found within the local window **09:11:07–09:14:00 ET**; therefore, local peaks/deviations cannot be assessed.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): in **Pre-Market** conditions, liquidity is typically limited; comparatively **low trade counts/volumes** can still be meaningful relative to baseline, and **wider spread dispersion** is generally expected. Here, the provided session panel shows baseline dispersion with **Bid_Ask_Spread ranging from -2 to 2**, and typical activity levels with **median Trade_Count = 1** and **median Trade_Volume = 55 shares** (noting substantial variability up to **29 trades** and **8,362 shares** at the maximum).

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If Yes: **Unavailable.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Procedural transition.**
- This packet is tracked because it moves from forecasting-limitation commentary (“forecasting precision remains limited…”) into a **speaker posture/acknowledgment segment** (“Bruce and I are grateful…”) that functions as a handoff bridge, redirecting the narrative trajectory away from uncertainty framing.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False** and **After_has_numeric_cue=False**; both sides are predominantly qualitative, shifting from narrative comparison (“results announced today… compared to our estimates three months ago”) to qualitative operational statements (“**responding quickly**…”, “**working hard**…”, “beginning to integrate two important acquisitions…”), without introducing new numeric disclosure in the after excerpt.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 1.0; delta_after = 0.96705; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable accumulation intensity** suggests the cumulative tone continues to build at a comparable rate across the change point, consistent with a rhetorical transition that sustains positive evaluative language rather than introducing a sharp tonal acceleration or deceleration.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable**, because **no market rows** were found within the local window **09:16:11–09:19:18 ET**; therefore, local peaks/deviations cannot be assessed.
- Session baseline only (Pre-Market context): given **Pre-Market** microstructure conditions (limited baseline liquidity), the session panel indicates central tendencies of **Quote_Revision_Frequency median = 7.5** (with observed range **1 to 34**) and **Quote_Volatility median ≈ 16.46** (range **0.018 to 65.383**). Trade activity is similarly sparse at baseline (**median Trade_Count = 1; median Trade_Volume = 55 shares**), with substantial dispersion up to **29 trades** and **8,362 shares**, reinforcing that interpretation should emphasize variability rather than assuming uniform depth.
