## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation)

- Opening remarks emphasize a strong fiscal 2021 outcome: net sales surpassing $1 billion, double‑digit Q4 sales and adjusted EBITDA growth, and outperformance versus category benchmarks in key segments.
- Management highlights brand strength and portfolio diversification, stressing broad-based growth across Atkins and Quest, forms (bars, shakes, “snackier” products), channels (mass, convenience, e‑commerce), and geographies (notably North America and Australia).
- A recurring theme is resilient execution in a “challenging environment,” including supply chain management, inflationary pressures, and COVID‑related mobility restrictions, with repeated references to stable margins and steady cash flow under an asset‑light, outsourced model.
- Supply chain cost inflation is framed as a significant ongoing headwind, mitigated by prior price increases, cost savings initiatives, favorable mix, and disciplined trade promotion.
- The narrative underscores strong innovation and marketing investment: robust product pipeline, targeted advertising (including new television campaigns for both Atkins and Quest), and support for new formats and snacking occasions.
- Outlook commentary is confident: management expects continued solid net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth into fiscal 2022, with growth skewed to the first half given tougher comparisons later in the year, and continued focus on increasing shareholder value.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Over the full Presentation window (from about 5 seconds to roughly 1,079 seconds), cumulative tone rises from near zero to above 60, indicating persistently positive tone at the sentence level.
- Between roughly 30–180 seconds, tone steepens sharply as the prepared remarks move from neutral housekeeping to highly favorable descriptions of business acceleration, brand gains, innovation success, and margin stability.
- From approximately 180–600 seconds, the slope remains strongly positive with occasional sharp downward inflections when management discusses category declines, supply chain challenges, mobility restrictions, and divestiture headwinds; these are quickly followed by renewed positive increments tied to share gains, growth metrics, and e‑commerce strength.
- After about 600 seconds, the cumulative tone continues to trend upward, though with a somewhat more moderate slope, reflecting a mix of upbeat growth, marketing, and outlook commentary alongside acknowledgments of persistent inflation and cost pressures.
- Change points identified in the tone series (e.g., around 178 seconds and 968 seconds) coincide with transitions into tightly packed positive performance disclosures and, later, with more granular financial details; both segments are associated with sustained net positive tone rather than reversals.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Pre-Market)

Context:  
- Pre‑Market session typically exhibits limited liquidity, lower trade volumes, and relatively wide bid‑ask spreads, so even modest deviations from baseline can be notable.

Using the provided Presentation‑phase window (approximately 08:29:05–08:57:46 ET):

- **Bid‑Ask Spread**
  - Local mean spread (~0.082) is higher than the Pre‑Market baseline mean (~−0.037), with a positive deviation of about 0.12 and a local range from ~0.039 to ~0.313.
  - In a low‑liquidity Pre‑Market context, this indicates spreads that are somewhat wider and more dispersed than typical for the session, though still within a moderate absolute range for this time of day.

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean imbalance (~0.03) is below the baseline mean (~0.15), with a negative deviation of about −0.12 and a narrow local range (0 to ~0.33).
  - This points to a more balanced book relative to the generally buy‑tilted baseline, suggesting limited directional skew in displayed depth during the Presentation.

- **Quote Revision Frequency and Volatility**
  - Local quote revision frequency (mean ~5, range 3–7) is below the baseline mean (~13.78), representing a deviation of about −8.78; the local maximum of 7 does not coincide with an extreme spike relative to the wider Pre‑Market distribution.
  - Local quote volatility (mean ~2.27) is slightly below the baseline (~2.57), with a modest range (about 0.58–3.96).
  - Together, these indicate quieter quoting activity and slightly subdued short-horizon price variability relative to typical Pre‑Market conditions.

- **Trade Count and Volume**
  - Local trade count (mean ~1.17 trades per bin) is lower than the baseline (~2.95), a deviation of about −1.79.
  - Local trade volume (mean ~16.7 shares per bin, median ~6.5, max 54) is well below the baseline mean (~551 shares), with a deviation of roughly −534 shares.
  - For a Pre‑Market environment, where participation is already thin, this points to relatively light trading activity during the Presentation phase, both in frequency and size, with no evident volume clustering.

- **Overall**
  - During the Presentation, market responses are characterized by:
    - Moderately wider and somewhat variable spreads.
    - More neutral order book positioning than the session average.
    - Fewer quote updates, slightly lower volatility, and depressed trading activity versus the Pre‑Market baseline.
  - Within the constraints of Pre‑Market liquidity, this pattern is consistent with relatively limited incremental trading and quoting intensity contemporaneous with the Presentation remarks.
