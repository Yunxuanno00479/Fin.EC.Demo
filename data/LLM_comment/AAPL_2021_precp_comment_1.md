### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition.**
- This is tracked because the language pivots from brief greeting/participation framing (“Good afternoon, everyone.”) into a more substantive opening narrative with appreciative emphasis (“It’s with great gratitude…”) that departs from purely procedural handoff phrasing.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates no numeric cues on either side (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False), and the excerpts are qualitative (“Good afternoon, everyone.” → “It’s with great gratitude…”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.94709; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation suggests no material change in information injection intensity at this inflection.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=219** in the window surrounding the change point.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +32.6464**, indicating higher quote updating than the session baseline.
- After-Hours context: In an **After-Hours** session, elevated quote revision activity and modestly higher trade activity can be meaningful relative to the lower-liquidity baseline, while wider spreads are generally expected.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **risk management pivot.**
- This is tracked because the narrative departs from strong-results framing (“strong double-digit growth… all-time revenue records”) toward an explicit re-centering on challenge and hardship (“the most challenging year…”, “an understatement to say… the challenge… as a community of individuals…”), marking a distinct tonal and thematic reorientation.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** shows no numeric cues on either side (False→False), and the shift is qualitative from performance characterization to societal/employee/community challenges.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.94863; delta_after=0.25804; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening** is consistent with a stabilization in accumulated communication intensity, aligning with a less metrics-dense, more reflective passage.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=219** within the surrounding window.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +993.885** (and **Trade_Count +4.54409**), indicating higher activity than baseline.
- After-Hours context: With **After-Hours** liquidity constraints, above-baseline trading volume and counts are notable in relative terms, even if absolute levels remain below regular-session norms.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **metric disclosure.**
- This is tracked because the discourse shifts from a section starter (“Let’s get started with hardware.”) into explicit scale/penetration metrics (“passed **1.65 billion** devices worldwide”), representing a clear pivot into quantified operational disclosure.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard.**
- Justification: The **after** excerpt contains explicit numerics (“**1.65 billion devices**”), and the broader immediate context continues with numeric reporting (e.g., “iPhone grew by **17%**…”), consistent with a hard-information segment.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation indicates continued steady information injection through the transition into quantified disclosures.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=117** in the local peak check.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.00575278** (reporting level difference only), indicating a wider spread environment than the baseline in this window.
- After-Hours context: **After-Hours** trading commonly features wider spreads; observing above-baseline spread conditions alongside steady trading activity is consistent with limited-liquidity microstructure during earnings-call disclosures.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **risk management pivot.**
- This is tracked because the narrative moves from a general commitment framing (“focused on how we can help…”) to a more cautionary, constraint-focused articulation (“none of us should have any illusions about the challenges we face…”), signaling a sharper emphasis on uncertainty and challenge recognition.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** is False→False, and the excerpts are qualitative, values-oriented statements without numerical performance content.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.85806; delta_after=-0.00213; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening** indicates reduced tone-momentum change, consistent with a steadier, reflective communication mode rather than escalating metrics delivery.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=130**.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +5.13332**, indicating higher volatility proxy than baseline in the local window.
- After-Hours context: In **After-Hours**, higher volatility proxies can be observed alongside episodic liquidity; interpretation should remain relative to the session’s wider-spread, lower-depth baseline.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition.**
- This is tracked because it marks the speaker transition into the CFO’s performance framing (“We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional business and financial performance…”), shifting the narrative from broader contextual remarks into finance-focused presentation structure.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** is False→False; the immediate after excerpt enumerates record categories but without figures (“all time records for revenue… earnings per share…”), indicating categorical (not numeric) emphasis at the inflection.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=0.01661; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: The **flattening** suggests a moderation in accumulated tone momentum as the presentation settles into a structured CFO overview.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=106**.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +1704.86**, indicating higher traded volume than the session baseline in the local window.
- After-Hours context: In an **After-Hours** environment, above-baseline volume is notable in relative terms, even as spreads and depth conditions can remain materially different from regular-session norms.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**As we move ahead into the March quarter, I’d like to provide some color on what we are seeing**…”
  - “**we will not be guiding to a specific revenue range**.”
  - “**we are providing some directional insights**…”
  - “**we believe growth will accelerate**…”
- This is tracked because the packet moves from balance-sheet endpoint reporting (“net cash was $84 billion…”) into capital return detail and then explicitly into March-quarter outlook language, representing a forward-oriented departure from backward-looking financial position metrics.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** is True→True, and both sides contain explicit numerics (e.g., “**$84 billion**” → “**over $30 billion**… **$3.6 billion**… **$24 billion**… **200 million**…”) consistent with continued hard-information density.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.00002; delta_after=0.99405; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: **Steepening** indicates a marked increase in accumulated communication intensity, aligned with dense capital return figures and the onset of directional forward-looking commentary.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
- One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=198**.
- One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +63.5797**, indicating substantially higher quote updating relative to baseline in this window.
- After-Hours context: During **After-Hours**, elevated quote revision activity and above-baseline trading metrics can be especially salient relative to the session’s limited-liquidity baseline; spread dispersion is expected to be higher and should be interpreted cautiously (dispersion/range only where relevant).
