### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification (if No): **procedural transition.**
- Explanation: The excerpted transition from “Now I’d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr.” to “Thank you, Daniel.” marks a speaker handoff that departs from the prior IR framing/disclaimer cadence into CEO-led opening remarks, resetting the narrative voice and tone level.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates no numeric cues before/after; the excerpts are procedural/relational (“turn the call over…”, “Thank you, Daniel.”) rather than quantitative disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.00928; delta_after = 0.11413; slope_pattern = Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: **Steepening** is observed, consistent with increased accumulated communication intensity immediately after the handoff.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 34** (local_max).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -11.566** (local quote update intensity below the Regular-session baseline).
- Regular-session context: In **Regular** hours, the baseline for quotes/trades is higher and dispersion is expected; within this context, the provided deviations indicate **sub-baseline trade activity** (e.g., Trade_Volume deviation **-343.815**) alongside **lower quote revisions** in the local window, while spread values include negatives and are therefore reported only via dispersion/range rather than sign interpretation.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification (if No): **risk management pivot.**
- Explanation: The narrative shifts from a broad setup (“2022 is off to a much more challenging start.”) to risk-specific operational constraints tied to Omicron (“impacting… demand… and the number of crews”), constituting a tracked departure from the preceding recovery/strength framing toward downside-risk articulation.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** is true both before and after, and the immediate continuation in the window includes explicit quantities (“canceled approximately **1,000** flights… **4%** of our Q1 schedule”), reinforcing a quantitative/operationally concrete register on both sides of the change point.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.97364; delta_after = -0.99976; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulation intensity is observed; the cumulative tone continues to move with a similarly negative increment, consistent with sustained risk-focused information injection rather than an acceleration.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 78** (local_max).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 8.5292** (locally higher quote volatility than the Regular-session baseline).
- Regular-session context: In **Regular** hours, elevated quote activity and volatility can be variable across bins; here, the local window shows **above-baseline quote volatility and slightly above-baseline quote revision frequency** (deviation **+1.43396**) observed alongside **below-baseline trading counts/volume** (Trade_Count **-1.35417**, Trade_Volume **-375.415**), with bid-ask spread containing negatives and therefore summarized only in terms of dispersion.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking phrases (if Yes): “**we expect that going forward**”.
- Explanation: The excerpted move from near-term procedural guidance placement (“Jose will share our Q1 guidance…”) into reiterated strategic positioning and explicit forward-looking language (“we expect that going forward…”) marks a tracked transition from near-term handoff framing toward higher-level strategic outlook.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates no numeric cues before/after; the content centers on qualitative positioning (“proven and strong business model… strongest balance sheet”) and forward-looking expectation rather than numeric reporting.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 1.0; delta_after = 1.0; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulated communication intensity is observed, consistent with a continuation of positive-toned strategic narrative without a material change in momentum.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 78** (local_max).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 10.1006** (locally higher quote update intensity than the Regular-session baseline).
- Regular-session context: In **Regular** hours, quote revision frequency often clusters around a higher baseline; the local deviations indicate **above-baseline quoting activity** and **above-baseline quote volatility** (deviation **+7.06903**) temporally aligned with this strategic/forward-looking segment, while **trade activity remains below baseline** (Trade_Volume deviation **-383.799**, Trade_Count **-1.27083**). Bid-ask spread values include negatives and are therefore described only via dispersion/range.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification (if No): **metric disclosure.**
- Explanation: The narrative shifts from reporting a quarter cash metric (“cash buildup of approximately $84 million”) to definitional framing (“we exclude… include capex… payment of debt… leases”), constituting a tracked departure from level reporting toward measurement construction/eligibility criteria.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Hard.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** is true before and after, and the excerpts remain anchored in accounting/measurement constructs (“cash buildup measure… exclude… include capex… debt principal and interest… leases”), preserving a hard-information register even as the focus moves from a value to a definition.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -2e-05; delta_after = -2e-05; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: **Stable** accumulated communication intensity is observed; the cumulative tone change is approximately flat across the boundary, consistent with technical definitional clarification rather than a sharp information surge.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check = 58** (local_max).
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Order_Book_Imbalance local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 0.165029** (locally more positive imbalance relative to the Regular-session baseline).
- Regular-session context: In **Regular** hours, both order-book imbalance and quoting can vary meaningfully across short windows; in the provided local window, **above-baseline quote revision frequency** (deviation **+7.7673**) co-occurs with **lower quote volatility** (deviation **-11.1983**) and **sub-baseline trading intensity** (Trade_Count **-2.75417**, Trade_Volume **-444.415**). Bid-ask spread includes negatives and is therefore reported only in terms of dispersion rather than directional interpretation.
