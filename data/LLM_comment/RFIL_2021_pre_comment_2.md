## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–898s)

- Extensive forward‑looking and non‑GAAP framing, with formal risk and disclaimer language front‑loaded in the first ~170 seconds.
- Strongly positive depiction of operating performance: sequential and year‑over‑year revenue growth, higher gross margins, and a return to operating profitability excluding temporary credits.
- Emphasis on record and expanding backlog, with specific reference to large multimillion‑dollar hybrid fiber orders and broad exposure across all Tier‑1 wireless carriers.
- Strategic positioning around 5G infrastructure: hybrid fiber, small cell, and DAC thermal cooling solutions presented as complementary growth platforms, including extension into cable operators, utilities, and edge‑computing‑type customers.
- Acknowledgment of mixed near‑term dynamics in small cell (delayed spend, redesigns around C‑band spectrum) alongside repeated statements of longer‑term demand potential.
- Additional growth levers highlighted via M&A intentions and a dedicated board committee, supported by a strong balance sheet and cash position.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Early operator/IR housekeeping (0–~170s) is near‑neutral to mildly negative in tone, reflecting legal disclaimers and risk language; cumulative tone stays close to flat and slightly negative through this interval.
- Once the CEO begins detailed business commentary (~190s onward), cumulative tone turns sharply and persistently positive, with multiple sentences assigned the highest positive tone score.  
  - Between roughly 190s and 380s, the slope of cumulative tone is steep, reflecting intensive injection of upbeat information around sales growth, historic backlog levels, Tier‑1 customer wins, and 5G‑related product positioning.
- Around 380–430s there is a brief flattening and partial dip in cumulative tone, coinciding with discussion of delayed small‑cell spending, performance issues, and deployment plan reconsiderations.
- From approximately 430s through the CFO’s discussion to ~900s, the cumulative tone resumes a strong upward trajectory:
  - CEO segments stress backlog, DAC opportunities, normalization in industrial/defense demand, and M&A ambitions.
  - CFO remarks reinforce this with quantified growth, margin expansion, strengthening backlog, and expectations of continued sequential and year‑over‑year revenue growth.
- Overall, the Presentation phase displays a clearly upward cumulative‑tone profile, with short local corrections but a consistently steep positive slope, indicating a concentrated period of positive information injection over the bulk of the prepared remarks.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (After-Hours)

**Context:**  
- After‑hours trading typically exhibits low liquidity, relatively wide and noisy spreads, and sparse quoting/trading activity.  
- Against this backdrop, even modest deviations in volumes or quote activity from the session average can be meaningful relative to the thin baseline.

**Bid–Ask Spread & Order Book**

- Local average bid‑ask spread is slightly narrower than the broader after‑hours mean (local mean ~0.003 vs baseline ~0.054), with a similar dispersion profile (comparable standard deviations and a range including extreme values).  
  - In an after‑hours context, this suggests that, on average over the Presentation window, spreads are not unusually wide and may be somewhat tighter than the broader session norm.
- Order‑book imbalance is mildly less negative on average (local mean about 0.05 higher than baseline), indicating a somewhat more balanced order book but still within typical after‑hours dispersion.

**Quotes and Volatility**

- Quote revision frequency is modestly above the session mean (local mean higher by ~0.60 revisions per bin, with a local maximum of 16 revisions).  
  - Given limited after‑hours quoting, this indicates slightly more active quote updating during the Presentation window than the broader after‑hours baseline, though still within the observed dispersion.
- The local quote‑volatility proxy is close to the baseline (difference in means ~0.03), with similar variability and range.  
  - This points to no pronounced increase in short‑horizon price variability relative to typical after‑hours conditions.

**Trades and Volumes**

- Trade count per bin is marginally above the baseline (local mean higher by ~0.14 trades), with a comparable range and dispersion.  
  - In regular hours this deviation would be small; in after‑hours, it indicates slightly more frequent trading but not an extreme concentration of activity.
- Trade volume per bin is somewhat higher than the session‑wide mean (local mean exceeds baseline by ~20 shares, or ~2.0×10⁻⁵ million shares), again modest in absolute size but incrementally elevated given the thin after‑hours setting.
- Overall, trading and quoting activity during the Presentation phase co‑occurs with:
  - Slightly tighter average spreads,
  - A modest uptick in quote revisions,
  - Slightly higher trade counts and volumes,
  all within the broad variability observed for the after‑hours baseline rather than standing out as extreme dislocations.
