## Change Point at Transcript 1649.262s (and Dimension clear)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**we're running it until the end of this fiscal year, which is October, November, and we'll make the call at that time** whether we use the cash to buy… do an M&A or to buy back our shares.”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.
  - The packet marks a tracked inflection because the interaction shifts from near-term operating commentary (e.g., “**we see cloud also hanging up…**”) to a time-bound capital allocation decision framework (“**October, November… make the call at that time**”), explicitly re-anchoring the discussion to an upcoming decision point.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the excerpts are primarily qualitative clarifications and conditional policy statements (e.g., “**we'll make the call at that time whether we use the cash…**”), rather than metric-heavy disclosures within this change-point boundary.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.847; delta_after=0.836; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).
  - For the **clear** dimension, the slope is **stable to marginally flattening**, consistent with a continuation of accumulated communication intensity rather than a sharp escalation; the manager reiterates a previously stated decision rule (“**I stick by that answer still now**”) with limited incremental clarification at the change point itself.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.
  - Local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check shows local_max=17** within the available window.
  - Deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 0.262857** (local above baseline), while **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -2.13912** (local below baseline).
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).
  - Given the **After-Hours** session context—where liquidity is typically thinner and spreads are expected to be wider—the observed pattern is best characterized as **moderately elevated quote updating relative to baseline alongside comparatively subdued trading volume**, which can still be meaningful relative to the after-hours baseline even when absolute volumes are not large.
