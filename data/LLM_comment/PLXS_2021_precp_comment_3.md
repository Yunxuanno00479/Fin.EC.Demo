### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **procedural transition**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The discourse departs from opening greetings (“**Good morning, everyone.**”) into a slide-directed results cadence (“**Please advance to slide three for a discussion of our fiscal third quarter results.**”), marking a tracked transition from preliminaries to the quantitative results narrative.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The numeric cue switches on after the change point, moving from non-numeric greeting to explicit metric disclosure: “**revenue of $814 million, GAAP operating margin of 4.5 percent, and GAAP EPS of 95 cents.**”

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.0; delta_after=0.94489; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening**, consistent with an increase in accumulated tone momentum aligned with dense results-related information injection immediately after the slide transition.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): With **Pre-Market** liquidity typically limited, even modest trading/quoting responses can be meaningful relative to baseline; however, **no session baseline panel is available in provided data**, so response magnitude cannot be contextualised quantitatively here.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **procedural transition**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The narrative transitions from a speaker handoff/greeting (“**Good morning.**”) into operational-performance discussion via slide navigation (“**Please advance to slide six for a review of our performance by market sector.**”), representing a tracked departure from introductory remarks to sector/operations content.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Numeric cues remain absent on both sides, shifting from greeting to qualitative operational framing: “**significantly impacted by workforce containments**” (no explicit numeric metric disclosed immediately after the change point).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=2e-05; delta_after=-0.99954; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening**, indicating a sharper change in accumulated tone momentum coincident with a shift into more adverse qualitative operational commentary.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): Pre-Market conditions generally feature **thin depth and sporadic quoting**, so dispersion in microstructure measures would not be unexpected; nevertheless, **baseline metrics are unavailable in provided data**, preventing calibration of any contemporaneous response scale.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking guidance phrase(s) (quoted): “**Therefore, I will focus on the expectations for the sectors for the fiscal fourth quarter.**”
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The tracked departure is a pivot from backward-looking disruption/problem recap (“**significantly impacted**… “**missed expectations**”) to explicitly forward-oriented sector expectations for the next quarter.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Numeric cues are absent on both sides at the packet boundary; the shift is from qualitative resolution/operations status (“**we have solved the supplier quality issue**”) to qualitative demand commentary (“**continued strong demand**”) before subsequent numeric guidance appears later in the window.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-3e-05; delta_after=1.0; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening**, consistent with intensified accumulated communication as the remarks move into expectation-setting language for the fiscal fourth quarter.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): In Pre-Market trading, **limited liquidity baseline** means that observable quote/trade changes (if present) may be relatively salient; however, **no local evidence and no baseline panel are provided**, so no response comparison can be stated.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- Forward-looking guidance phrase(s) (quoted): “**as we prepare for higher revenue anticipated in the fiscal fourth quarter.**”
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The tracked departure is from working-capital metric reporting (e.g., “**inventory days increased by 19**”) to an inventory-procurement justification explicitly tied to anticipated next-quarter revenue conditions.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The boundary moves away from a numeric working-capital metric (“**inventory days increased by 19**”) toward qualitative/anticipatory rationale (“**prepare for higher revenue anticipated**”), and the numeric cue hint switches off after the change point.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.99945; delta_after=0.0393; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: **Flattening**, indicating reduced incremental accumulated tone momentum, consistent with a stabilization in information injection intensity after the sharp metric statement.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): Pre-Market microstructure commonly reflects **wider spreads and lower volumes** versus Regular session; nonetheless, **session baseline is unavailable in provided data**, so the scale of any contemporaneous responses cannot be benchmarked.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **metric disclosure**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The tracked departure is a narrowing from a general offsetting-statement (“**Partially offsetting… increases in both payable days and customer deposit days.**”) to a specific metric detail (“**Customer deposit days increased by two days**”), representing increased granularity within working-capital discussion.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: The numeric cue hint is marked false on both sides despite the presence of a small-number metric in the after excerpt; substantively, the transition is from qualitative framing of offsets to a more specific line-item explanation (“**worked with customers to secure and offset related inventory**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.91769; delta_after=0.15647; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: **Flattening**, consistent with decelerating accumulated tone momentum as the discussion moves from a higher-intensity point to incremental detail.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): Under Pre-Market conditions, baseline activity is typically **thin and discontinuous**, so response measures often show higher relative variability; however, **no baseline panel is available**, so only qualitative session context can be provided.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **metric disclosure**.
- One-sentence rationale (excerpt-based): The tracked departure is from a generic lead-in (“**A few other notes for the fiscal fourth quarter.**”) to specific quantified guidance items (“**Non-operating expenses… $3.8 to $4.2 million**”), marking a shift into itemised numerical guidance detail.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard**.
- Justification: The numeric cue hint turns on after the change point, with explicit ranges disclosed: “**Non-operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.8 to $4.2 million.**”

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.0; delta_after=-1e-05; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity)**.
- Interpret: **Steepening** (as reported by the preprocessing proxy), indicating a tracked increase in accumulated communication intensity aligned with the onset of quantified line-item guidance.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Unavailable** (Panel data unavailable; window time unavailable).
- Local vs Baseline Deviation: **Unavailable** (panel missing).
- Session baseline contextualisation (Pre-Market): In Pre-Market trading, **limited liquidity baseline** and potentially **wider spreads** can make even small absolute shifts in trades/quotes appear salient; however, **both local evidence and the session baseline panel are unavailable in provided data**, so no quantitative local-versus-baseline comparison can be stated.
