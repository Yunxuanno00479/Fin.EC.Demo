## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–~780 seconds)

- Formal opening with procedural remarks, disclaimer language, and introduction of senior management and new Investor Relations leadership (0–120 seconds).
- CEO emphasis on employee commitment, leadership transitions, and confidence in the new IR head, framed within the ongoing COVID-19 context (120–190 seconds).
- Discussion of diverging regional pandemic dynamics, with continued travel restrictions in some Latin American markets versus robust recovery in U.S.-linked and leisure routes (190–260 seconds).
- Operational recovery narrative: hub reactivation, aircraft reactivation, capacity ramp-up, and improving demand indicators (e.g., higher load factors, increased ASMs) (240–320 seconds).
- Strongly positive framing of quarterly performance: higher revenues, improving unit costs, return to operating profit on a reported basis, robust liquidity, and superior operational metrics (on-time performance, completion rates) (320–420 seconds).
- CFO deep-dive into detailed financials and balance sheet: reported versus adjusted results, unit costs, yields, cash accretion, liquidity, fleet optimization, and a cautiously framed outlook highlighting persistent uncertainty, no full-year guidance, and a “cash neutral” stance for the next quarter (480–780 seconds).

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- Early remarks (0–120 seconds) remain close to neutral, with modest oscillations around zero as procedural and disclaimer language is delivered.
- From approximately 120 to 320 seconds, the cumulative tone rises sharply, reflecting a sustained sequence of strongly positive sentences (employee recognition, hub and capacity recovery, traffic metrics, revenue growth, cost improvements).  
  - This segment exhibits a steep positive slope, indicating a high intensity of information injection in the form of favorable operational and financial updates.
- Around 320–420 seconds, the slope remains positive and elevated as additional positive operational metrics and strategic positioning (Wingo expansion, hub advantages) are highlighted, keeping the cumulative tone on an upward trajectory.
- From roughly 480 seconds onward, cumulative tone remains high but becomes more volatile:
  - Positive contributions from net profit headlines, cost performance, yields, cash accretion, and liquidity.
  - Interspersed with material negative-valued sentences when the CFO discusses adjusted losses, special items, ongoing uncertainty, lack of full-year guidance, and expectation of being only cash neutral in the next quarter.
- Overall, the Presentation phase shows:
  - A transition from flat/neutral to a steeply rising cumulative tone in the CEO’s section.
  - A high but somewhat flatter and more oscillatory profile in the CFO’s section, as detailed metrics and explicit mention of risks and uncertainty partially offset earlier optimism.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

Using the Regular session baseline as reference, the Presentation window (approximately 10:59:02–11:15:00 ET) co-occurs with the following market microstructure patterns:

- **Bid–Ask Spread**
  - Local mean: 0.0513; baseline mean: 0.0522; deviation: approximately −0.0009.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - Spreads during the Presentation are effectively in line with the Regular-session average, indicating no pronounced tightening or widening relative to the broader session.  
    - Given Regular-session conditions (higher liquidity baseline), this suggests spreads are typical for the day, with substantial dispersion possible (local std around 0.323, range −2 to 2).

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean: −0.011; baseline mean: −0.037; deviation: +0.027.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - Imbalance is modestly closer to zero than the session average, pointing to slightly less persistent one-sided depth than baseline.  
    - In a Regular session, this represents a mild shift toward more balanced order book conditions, but still within normal dispersion (local std ~0.365).

- **Quote Revision Frequency**
  - Local mean: 50.4 vs baseline mean: 35.4; deviation: +15.0, with a local maximum of 102.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - Quote updates during the Presentation are substantially more frequent than the Regular-session average, and peak activity reaches the upper end of the observed distribution.  
    - For a Regular session, this indicates an elevated level of quote activity/refreshing around this phase, suggesting more intense local updating relative to the broader intraday pattern.

- **Quote Volatility**
  - Local mean: 11.0 vs baseline mean: 13.2; deviation: −2.17.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - The volatility proxy is somewhat lower than the session average, indicating that, despite elevated quote revision frequency, the magnitude of price changes per interval is somewhat more contained than typical for the day.  
    - In Regular hours, this points to active but relatively controlled price dynamics.

- **Trade Count**
  - Local mean: 3.84 vs baseline mean: 3.54; deviation: +0.30.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - The number of trades per bin during the Presentation is slightly above the Regular-session mean, but well within the wide cross-sectional dispersion (std ~6.5, max 34).  
    - This suggests mildly elevated transaction activity relative to the broader day, but not an extreme concentration.

- **Trade Volume**
  - Local mean: ~289 shares vs baseline mean: ~258 shares; deviation: +30.4 shares.  
  - Interpretation:  
    - Traded volume per bin is modestly higher than the session average, again within substantial dispersion (std ~531 shares, max 3,586).  
    - For a Regular session with higher baseline activity, this indicates a slightly more active trading environment, but not an outlier relative to the day’s range.

**Summary of Local Responses (Regular Session Context)**

- The Presentation phase occurs in a Regular market environment with:
  - **Normal spreads** and slightly more **balanced order book conditions** than baseline.
  - **Markedly higher quote revision frequency** alongside **slightly lower volatility**, indicating more frequent but relatively moderate price adjustments.
  - **Marginally higher trade counts and volumes** compared with the session mean, consistent with a somewhat more engaged but not extreme trading backdrop during the Presentation portion of the call.
