## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–1,133 seconds)

- Formal introductions and safe-harbor / non-GAAP framing set a procedural, compliance-focused opening before transitioning to content.
- Management emphasizes leadership transition at the CFO level, coupled with strong affirmations of succession quality and institutional continuity.
- ESG positioning features prominently: progress on external ESG ratings, governance and social scores, and the firm’s role in delivering essential government services to vulnerable populations.
- Fiscal 2021 is portrayed as a “dynamic” year with substantial growth: large COVID-response revenues, significant acquisitions, and broad-based segment recovery, especially outside the U.S.
- Detailed segment-level review underscores the balance of positive COVID-response and acquisition-driven revenue against margin headwinds from contract write-offs, startup losses, and pandemic-related disruptions to core programs.
- Forward-looking guidance stresses normalized organic growth excluding temporary COVID and census effects, a back-half-weighted earnings profile, and expectations for improving margins as new contracts and restarts scale.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- The cumulative tone starts near zero and rises steadily and strongly over the Presentation, reaching a high positive level by around 1,130 seconds.
- Early operator and legal-disclaimer remarks keep tone close to neutral, but the introduction of management and succession comments around 100–230 seconds initiates a sharp positive upward movement.
- Subsequent discussion of ESG achievements, segment revenue growth, COVID-response contributions, acquisitions, and improved cash flows sustains a generally steep positive slope, despite localized negative dips when describing write-offs, short-term margin pressure, and delayed core-program recovery (e.g., around 350–410 seconds and 1000–1030 seconds).
- The slope remains upward on net, indicating persistent and sizeable positive information injection intensity across the Presentation, especially in sections highlighting normalized organic growth, new awards, and back-half 2022 improvement expectations.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Pre-Market Context)

- **Market Session context (Pre-Market):**
  - Liquidity is limited relative to Regular hours; even modest trading and quoting activity can be informative.
  - Baseline spreads tend to be wider and trade counts lower than in the Regular session, so deviations should be interpreted against this lower-activity backdrop.

- **Bid–Ask Spread**
  - Local mean spread (≈0.082) is higher than the session mean (≈0.014), with a relatively tight local range (≈0.023–0.204).
  - In a Pre-Market setting where wide spreads are common, this represents moderately elevated but not extreme dispersion relative to the session average, consistent with somewhat more cautious or less competitive quoting around the Presentation window.

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean imbalance is slightly negative (≈–0.06) versus a modestly positive session mean (≈0.07).
  - The range (–0.5 to 0.5) indicates both buy- and sell-leaning episodes but no persistent, extreme directional skew; the Presentation window co-occurs with a mild tilt away from the typical positive baseline.

- **Quote Revision Frequency and Quote Volatility**
  - Local quote revision frequency (mean ≈10) is below the session mean (≈16), and local volatility (mean ≈4.6) is also below its baseline (≈11.3), though there is a local peak frequency of 29.
  - For a Pre-Market environment, this points to relatively subdued quote-update activity and lower short-horizon volatility during most of the Presentation, with occasional bursts of activity rather than sustained turbulence.

- **Trade Count and Trade Volume**
  - Local trade counts (mean ≈1.46) are below the session mean (≈3.8), whereas average trade volume per bin (≈396 shares) is slightly above the baseline (≈366 shares), with a wide dispersion (up to ≈4,600 shares).
  - Given the low-liquidity Pre-Market baseline, the Presentation window thus co-occurs with:
    - Fewer trades than typical for the session on a per-bin basis.
    - Comparable to slightly higher share size when trades occur.
  - This pattern is consistent with relatively sparse, but occasionally sizable, transactions rather than sustained high-frequency trading around the Presentation.

- **Overall local-vs-baseline interpretation**
  - During the Presentation, market microstructure responses are characterized by:
    - Somewhat **wider spreads** and **lower quote-activity and volatility** than the Pre-Market baseline.
    - **Lower trade counts** but **slightly elevated trade volumes** when trades occur.
  - In the context of the Pre-Market’s inherently thin liquidity, these responses suggest a window of relatively calm, moderately more dispersed quoting and sporadic, sometimes larger, trades temporally aligned with the firm’s predominantly positive and information-dense Presentation.
