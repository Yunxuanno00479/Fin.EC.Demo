## 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 0–861 seconds)

- Opening formalities and standard legal/compliance language, including forward‑looking statement and non‑GAAP disclosures.  
- Strong first‑quarter performance emphasis: double‑digit revenue growth, substantial adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion across all three segments.  
- Balance sheet strength and capital allocation: low leverage, absence of revolver use, debt repayment, and opportunistic share repurchases, with continued focus on cash generation.  
- Upgraded full‑year outlook and detailed guidance: higher sales growth expectations by segment, consolidated low‑teens revenue growth, and maintenance of adjusted EBITDA margins in the low‑12% range.  
- Constructive macro and demand backdrop across North America and Europe, with particular strength in repair and remodel activity and semi‑custom cabinets.  
- Acknowledgment of headwinds—input cost inflation, Texas/Gulf weather disruptions, and labor tightness—framed against pricing actions, pass‑through mechanisms, and operational initiatives.

## 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone)

- The cumulative tone begins slightly negative in the introductory operator remarks and legal disclosures, remaining near flat through roughly the first 80 seconds.  
- A marked positive inflection occurs once financial results are introduced (around 84–200 seconds), with successive highly positive sentences on revenue growth, EBITDA expansion, and improved cash metrics pushing the cumulative tone steeply higher into clearly positive territory.  
- From approximately 200–540 seconds, the slope remains strongly upward, reflecting a dense cluster of positive statements on outlook, guidance, macro demand conditions, and segment‑level performance in both North America and Europe.  
- Around 544–630 seconds there is a noticeable but temporary flattening and partial retracement in cumulative tone as management discusses inflationary pressures, supply disruptions, and labor constraints; tone remains net positive but with a reduced slope.  
- After roughly 636 seconds, as segment details and consolidated performance are revisited, the slope steepens again, with a sustained positive build through the end of the Presentation, indicating continued information injection in a favorable direction despite acknowledged challenges.  
- Overall, the Presentation phase exhibits a generally steep and consistently positive cumulative tone trajectory, with brief local flattening where operational headwinds are discussed, rather than a reversion to neutral.

## 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session)

**Context:**  
- Regular session trading implies higher underlying liquidity and more frequent quoting/trading activity; deviations from baseline are evaluated relative to this higher‑activity environment.

**Bid-Ask Spread & Order Book Imbalance**

- Bid_Ask_Spread:  
  - Local mean ≈ 0.015 vs baseline ≈ 0.0266 (difference ≈ −0.0113).  
  - Dispersion (std ≈ 0.278) is sizable but comparable to baseline dispersion (≈ 0.326).  
  - Interpretation: During the Presentation window, spreads are modestly tighter on average than the broader regular‑session baseline, within a wide but typical range for this stock.  
- Order_Book_Imbalance:  
  - Local mean ≈ 0.107 vs baseline ≈ 0.093 (slightly more positive).  
  - Both local and baseline show similar dispersion and range (−1 to 1).  
  - Interpretation: Book imbalance skews mildly more positive on average, but within the normal variability observed during the day.

**Quote Dynamics**

- Quote_Revision_Frequency:  
  - Local mean ≈ 20.8 vs baseline ≈ 20.2; deviation is small and positive (≈ 0.58).  
  - Local maximum of 46 revisions per bin falls well within regular‑session dispersion, not at an extreme tail.  
  - Interpretation: Quoting activity during the Presentation is broadly aligned with session norms, with only a slight elevation in revision intensity.  
- Quote_Volatility:  
  - Local mean ≈ 4.46 vs baseline ≈ 3.36 (increase ≈ 1.10).  
  - Both phases show wide dispersion (local std ≈ 4.37; baseline ≈ 4.21).  
  - Interpretation: Price quote variability is somewhat higher than typical session levels, but still within the historically observed regular‑session range for this stock.

**Trading Activity**

- Trade_Count:  
  - Local mean ≈ 3.26 trades per bin vs baseline ≈ 3.04 (modest increase ≈ 0.22).  
  - Distribution overlaps heavily with the baseline (min 1, max 32 in both).  
  - Interpretation: Trade frequency is slightly elevated but not unusual for the regular session.  
- Trade_Volume:  
  - Local mean ≈ 248 shares per bin vs baseline ≈ 320 (decrease ≈ 71 shares, or −0.000071 million).  
  - Both periods exhibit high dispersion (local std ≈ 493 vs baseline ≈ 1,052), with overlapping ranges.  
  - Interpretation: Average trade size/volume per bin is marginally lower than the session baseline, but the distribution indicates this falls within ordinary intraday variability.

**Summary of Local vs Baseline**

- During the Presentation phase in regular trading hours, market responses are characterized by:  
  - Slightly tighter average spreads and modestly more positive book imbalance.  
  - Quote revision frequency close to baseline, alongside moderately higher quote‑level volatility.  
  - Trade counts that are marginally higher with somewhat lower average traded volume per bin.  
- Taken together, these patterns suggest market activity around the Presentation is broadly consistent with typical regular‑session conditions for this stock, with no pronounced dislocation relative to the intraday baseline.
