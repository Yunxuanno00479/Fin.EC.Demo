## Change Point at Transcript Unavailables (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No (Unavailable)**.
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance. **Unavailable**.
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Unavailable** (no Change Point packet content provided).
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts. **Unavailable** (no Q&A Change Point packets and no excerpt text were provided; per data context, no structural breaks were detected).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable in provided data.**
- Justification: **Unavailable in provided data** (no Change Point packet excerpts and no numeric cue snippets were provided to support a soft/hard characterization).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable.**
- Interpret: **Unavailable in provided data.** Given the stated absence of detected Q&A change points across dimensions, the packet-level accumulated communication intensity cannot be quantified; the provided context is consistent with *stable* interaction dynamics but is not sufficient for a slope-based interpretation.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- **Local Market Evidence Status: Unavailable** (no Local Evidence block and no Local-vs-Baseline Deviation table were provided for any Q&A packet; additionally, no Q&A packets exist in the supplied data context).
- Session baseline only (Regular session context):  
  - Regular trading typically exhibits higher baseline activity and substantial dispersion; interpretation therefore emphasizes variability rather than isolated spikes.  
  - Baseline central tendencies: Bid–Ask Spread median **0.006** (range **-2 to 2**, reportable as dispersion only), Order Book Imbalance median **0**, Quote Revision Frequency median **32.5**, Quote Volatility median **14.9165**, Trade Count median **1**, Trade Volume median **100** shares (max **5,010**).  
  - Without local packet windows, any statement about temporally aligned microstructure responses relative to this baseline is **Unavailable in provided data**.
