### 1) Narrative Themes (Presentation, 1–1000 seconds)

- Strong retrospective performance: management repeatedly highlights record 2021 revenue, earnings, free cash flow, and improved return on invested capital, with positive commentary on leverage reduction and balance sheet strength.
- Demand strength across segments: sustained and broad-based demand is emphasized in North American and European fenestration and cabinet components, supported by housing fundamentals, low mortgage rates, healthy R&R activity, and substantial customer backlogs.
- Inflation and supply chain headwinds: the narrative repeatedly references raw material cost inflation, labor constraints, logistics disruptions, backlogs, and limited visibility on deliveries as key operational challenges.
- Margin dynamics and pricing actions: management details margin pressure in several segments from inflation and normalized costs, but also discusses index-based pricing mechanisms, surcharges, and permanent price increases, framing margin expansion as achievable, particularly in the second half of 2022.
- Cash flow and capital allocation: despite lower year-on-year operating cash flow and free cash flow, the company underscores continued solid generation, substantial debt repayment, stock repurchases, a new share repurchase authorization, and a strong liquidity position.
- Outlook framed by optimism and caution: the tone pairs optimism about continued strong demand and strategic execution with caution around near-term margin pressure, seasonality, and unusually high uncertainty around supply chain and shipment cadence, used to justify withholding formal 2022 guidance for now.

### 2) Accumulated Communication (Cumulative Tone over the Presentation)

- The cumulative tone starts slightly positive during the operator’s remarks and turns sharply more positive once management begins discussing 2021 results around 37–120 seconds, as strong growth and revenue commentary are introduced.
- Through roughly 120–350 seconds, the trajectory alternates between steep positive steps (e.g., record sales, margin gains, deleveraging) and sharp negative inflections (e.g., inflation, supply chain issues, lower quarterly EBITDA), but the overall slope remains upward, indicating a net positive information flow despite acknowledging headwinds.
- Around 405–530 seconds, the presentation becomes strongly positive again as the CEO highlights record year performance, operational improvements, free cash flow, and team execution; cumulative tone steepens notably over this interval.
- From approximately 510–585 seconds, detailed discussion of COVID developments, supply chain stress, backlogs, and global inflation introduces a pronounced downward segment in cumulative tone, reflecting concentrated communication of adverse macro and operational conditions.
- Subsequent segment-level performance commentary from about 590–830 seconds returns to a generally positive upward slope, with repeated positive contributions from revenue growth, pricing power, segment-level margin expansion, and operational initiatives, interrupted by localized downward moves when quarterly margin compression is mentioned.
- In the closing portion (roughly 840–1000 seconds), cumulative tone remains firmly positive and continues to rise, as management emphasizes normalized corporate costs, solid cash flow, share repurchase authorization, strong positioning, and optimistic demand outlook, even while reiterating supply chain uncertainty and the decision not to provide formal guidance.
- Overall, the cumulative tone line is upward sloping across the Presentation, with intermittent steepening around record performance and strategic progress, and temporary flattening or partial reversals around macro risk and margin-pressure discussions; this pattern is consistent with relatively intense information injection that is net favorable but repeatedly tempered by explicit discussion of constraints and uncertainty.

### 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (Regular Session Context)

Using the 10:59:01–11:18:40 ET window for the Presentation and comparing with the broader Regular session baseline:

- **Bid-Ask Spread**
  - Local mean: 0.149 vs baseline mean 0.111 (difference ≈ +0.038).
  - Dispersion is high in both windows (local std ≈ 0.50 vs baseline 0.43) with the same observed maximum (2.0), and similar medians (0.011 locally vs 0.011 baseline).
  - In a Regular session, where spreads are typically tighter and more variable than in off-hours, this modestly higher average spread alongside wide dispersion suggests slightly elevated but not extreme quote uncertainty during the Presentation.

- **Order Book Imbalance**
  - Local mean: 0.066 vs baseline 0.078 (difference ≈ –0.012).
  - Both local and baseline show broad dispersion with values ranging from –1 to about 0.82, and a median of 0 in both cases.
  - In Regular trading conditions, this points to an order book that is broadly balanced on average, with no pronounced directional skew beyond what is commonly observed intraday.

- **Quote Revision Frequency**
  - Local mean: 23.21 vs baseline 22.57 (difference ≈ +0.64), with a local maximum of 49 (matching the highest observed in the local sample and at the phase onset).
  - Volatility proxy is slightly higher locally (3.71 vs 3.57; difference ≈ +0.13), with similar dispersion.
  - Given the Regular session’s inherently higher baseline activity, these small increases indicate quote updating and short-horizon volatility that are modestly more active than average but remain well within the typical intraday range.

- **Trade Count**
  - Local mean: 1.82 vs baseline 2.26 (difference ≈ –0.44).
  - Both environments exhibit substantial dispersion (local std ≈ 2.16 vs 3.13), with similar minima and somewhat lower local maxima (17 vs 23).
  - In the context of Regular trading, this suggests slightly fewer trades per interval during the Presentation window relative to the broader session, without indications of unusually intense print clustering.

- **Trade Volume**
  - Local mean: 122.2 shares vs baseline 120.4 (difference ≈ +1.8 shares; in million-shares terms ≈ +0.0000018).
  - Dispersion is large in both (std ≈ 223 vs 211, max 1200 in both), and medians are close (25 vs 29 shares).
  - For a Regular session, this near-equality in volumes indicates that share turnover during the Presentation is very close to typical intraday conditions, with standard variability in trade sizes and occasional larger prints.

- **Integrated Interpretation (Regular Session)**
  - During the Presentation, market Responses are broadly aligned with Regular-session baselines: quote activity and volatility are slightly elevated, spreads are modestly wider, while trade counts are slightly lower and volumes nearly unchanged.
  - Given the higher and more dispersed baseline levels characteristic of the Regular session, these deviations appear moderate in scale, suggesting that the phase co-occurs with market conditions that are active but not outsized relative to the broader trading window.
