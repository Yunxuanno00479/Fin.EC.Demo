### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**what we expect going forward**”
  - “**what we're seeing now in the market**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The discourse transitions from greetings (“Good morning, everyone.”) to an explicit roadmap that includes near-term market commentary and forward-looking expectations (“what we expect going forward”), marking a tracked re-orientation from opening formalities to outlook framing.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the after-excerpt is agenda/expectations language rather than quantitative disclosure (“brief review… discuss what we’re seeing… expect going forward”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.00021; delta_after=0.0; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening** is consistent with reduced incremental tone momentum and a procedural stabilization phase (Accumulated Communication), aligning with an agenda-setting transition rather than a dense information injection segment.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: **Bid_Ask_Spread=2** and **Order_Book_Imbalance=-1** are observed locally at **08:32:46.228 ET**; additionally, a **single trade** is recorded at **08:33:44.000 ET** (**Trade_Count=1; Trade_Volume=200**).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +50.3077** shares.
- Pre-Market context: Given the **limited liquidity baseline** typical of pre-market conditions, the presence of sparse trades alongside a wider observed spread is not unusual; interpretation should remain comparative to the provided baseline deviations rather than absolute levels.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  **Metric disclosure.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The narrative shifts from a qualitative summary of favorable comparisons (“comparisons… were all favorable”) to a specific performance metric and its subsequent attribution (“Gross profit margin was 25.3%…”, followed by cost and supply-chain commentary), representing a tracked step into margin quantification and explanation.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Hard.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=True**, and the after-excerpt contains explicit quantitative disclosure (“**Gross profit margin was 25.3% compared to 27.8%**…”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=-0.00033; delta_after=-0.99998; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: The **steepening** (more negative change in cumulative tone momentum) indicates heightened Accumulated Communication intensity, coinciding with a denser segment combining margin numbers and cost/supply-chain framing.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=3** (local peak check) and a contemporaneous reading shows **Quote_Revision_Frequency=3** at **08:45:00.000 ET** (with **Quote_Volatility=0.823** also reported in the same row).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.333333**.
- Pre-Market context: Under **pre-market limited liquidity**, modest elevations in quote updating (relative to baseline) can be salient even when trade prints remain sparse; wide spreads are also more commonly observed in this session.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**we do see room to improve our margins**”
  - “**large opportunities… in our pipeline**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The discourse turns from near-term cost-offset actions (“actively monitoring our pricing… making changes”) to an explicit forward-looking improvement channel via mix and pipeline (“room to improve our margins… opportunities… pipeline”), constituting a tracked re-direction toward prospective margin normalization themes.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the content is expectation/opportunity framing rather than immediate numeric reporting (“room to improve… opportunities… pipeline”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=-0.99954; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: With a **similar slope** designation, the Accumulated Communication intensity is treated as **stable** around the change point, indicating continuation in the rate of tone accumulation even as the content pivots from mitigation actions to improvement outlook.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=3** (local peak check), with a recorded **Trade_Volume=100** at **08:44:00.000 ET** (and **Trade_Count=1** in that bin).
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -123.692** shares (below baseline on average in the local window).
- Pre-Market context: In a **pre-market** setting where liquidity is constrained, a mixed profile—sporadic prints with below-baseline average local volume—can still be informative as a relative-to-baseline alignment; spreads and activity commonly exhibit higher dispersion than in regular hours.
