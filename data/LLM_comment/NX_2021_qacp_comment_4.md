### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.  
  - “**as we continue to develop it, we'll try to give a little more guidance in the future**”  
  - “**I don't want to come out and give targets or guidance this time**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The dialogue shifts from operational descriptions of capacity deployment (“adding … capacity,” “investing and spending”) toward deferring quantification and formal outlook (“no targets … this time”), representing a tracked change in how management frames the opportunity set.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  - **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  - The response emphasizes qualitative positioning and timing (“**pretty early into this**,” “**relatively new into this space**,” “**try to give… guidance in the future**”) rather than new quantified disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.585; delta_after=0.385; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  - **Flattening** in the optimistic cumulative tone indicates **reduced accumulated communication intensity**, consistent with a procedural/positioning pivot toward withholding targets and limiting incremental optimistic framing at this point in the Q&A.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - **Local observation:** Quote_Revision_Frequency exhibits a **local_max of 62** within the window (11:19:51–11:34:16 ET).
  - **Deviation-table highlight:** Quote_Revision_Frequency shows **local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +4.07143**, alongside Trade_Volume **+38.1386**.
- Regular-session context: In a **Regular** session, baseline activity is higher and dispersion is expected; the observed **above-baseline quote revision frequency and trade volume** are therefore best read as **comparatively elevated microstructure responses** during this packet’s surrounding window rather than unusual in absolute terms.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}.  
  - **Procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The packet marks a handoff from moderator introduction (“**Our next question comes from…**”) into an analyst’s follow-up line of inquiry (“**Can I just go further?**”), indicating a tracked transition in interaction structure rather than a substantive new guidance segment.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  - **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  - The “before” is greeting/turn-taking (“**Good morning**”), and the “after” continues qualitative exploration of channel dynamics (“**unique distribution challenges… SG&A… dynamics**”) without introducing quantified metrics.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.069; delta_after=0.104; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  - **Steepening** in the optimistic cumulative tone indicates **higher accumulated communication intensity**, consistent with the Q&A moving from formalities into a more content-rich discussion (distribution/channel requirements and market structure), even though it remains primarily qualitative.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - **Local observation:** Quote_Revision_Frequency reaches a **local_max of 62** (11:25:38–11:37:36 ET).
  - **Deviation-table highlight:** Quote_Revision_Frequency is **above baseline** (local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = **+2.06494**); Trade_Volume is also **above baseline** (**+12.7028**).
- Regular-session context: Given **Regular** trading’s higher baseline liquidity, the window’s **moderately above-baseline quoting and volume** is most appropriately characterized as **incremental elevation versus baseline**, not a low-liquidity anomaly.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.  
  - “**we expect at some point, probably more towards the second half of the year**”  
  - “**the inflationary environment will at least somewhat stabilize so we can catch up**”  
  - “**the slope of the inflation line will flatten or decrease**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  - The interaction moves from mechanics and lags (“**60 to 90 days**”) and near-term margin-neutral framing toward a **time-indexed conditional outlook** (“**second half of the year**” with stabilization assumptions), representing a tracked forward-looking reframing; the analyst’s caution about wording (“**not guidance… don’t want to put words in your mouth**”) also signals interactional uncertainty consistent with the excerpts.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  - **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=True; After_has_numeric_cue=False.  
  - The “before” contains explicit numeric framing around timing (“**60 to 90 days**,” “**$2 million or $3 million**” in the surrounding discussion), while the “after” shifts to qualitative/conditional expectations (“**at some point… second half of the year… stabilize**”) without adding new numbers.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.055; delta_after=0.35; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  - The sharp **steepening** in optimistic cumulative tone suggests a **higher intensity of accumulated communication**, consistent with management providing a more explicitly time-framed (though conditional) narrative around margin trajectory and inflation dynamics.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - **Local observation:** Bid-Ask Spread shows substantial **range/dispersion** in the local window (min **0.004**, max **2**), and Quote_Volatility reaches **11.933** (local max).
  - **Deviation-table highlight:** Bid_Ask_Spread is **above baseline** (local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = **+0.180092**) and Quote_Volatility is **above baseline** (**+2.37369**), while Quote_Revision_Frequency is **below baseline** (**-7.97143**) and Trade_Volume is **below baseline** (**-29.2665**).
- Regular-session context: In a **Regular** session, spreads are typically tighter and volumes higher on average; thus, the co-occurrence of **wider-than-baseline spread dispersion and higher quote volatility** alongside **sub-baseline trading activity and quote revisions** is most consistent with a local microstructure state where price-setting appears more volatile even as executed activity is comparatively muted within this window.
