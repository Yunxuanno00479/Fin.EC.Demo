## Change Point at Transcript 2199.444s (and Dimension cautious)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **procedural transition**.
- One-sentence tracked departure (excerpt-based): The exchange shifts from a substantive Q&A thread to operator-style flow control—“**Thanks, Richard. Next question, please.**”—before the subsequent analyst re-engages with a more challenging time-scoping question (“**put you a little bit on the spot**”), marking a tracked departure in interaction structure rather than content.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint** indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the excerpts are non-quantitative/procedural (“**Next question, please**”) followed by qualitative pressure for clarification (“**time scope that… fiscal 22 or fiscal 23?**”) without newly introduced point estimates in the packet excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.066; delta_after = -0.066; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret (dimension-specific): For the **cautious** cumulative tone dimension, the unchanged negative step size indicates **stable** accumulated communication intensity across the change point (i.e., no steepening or flattening in the accumulation profile is observed at this inflection).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - ONE local observation (local evidence): **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check shows local_max = 35**, indicating episodic quote-update bursts within the pre-market window.
  - ONE deviation-table highlight (local vs baseline): **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = 3.74121** (and **Trade_Volume_M = 3.74121e-06**), indicating local average trading volume is **above** the session baseline over the evaluated window.
- Market session context (Pre-Market): Given **pre-market’s limited-liquidity baseline**, even modest absolute differences in trade activity and quote updating may be **informative relative to baseline variability**, while dispersion in spreads is generally expected; accordingly, this packet is temporally aligned with **slightly higher-than-baseline volume** and **elevated quote revision frequency** in the local window, without implying causality.
