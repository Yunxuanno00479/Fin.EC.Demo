## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension assertive)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure is a shift from a “left field” question about potential VA EHR modernization delays (“*Cerner… EHR modernization for the VA… delays… collateral damage*”) to a new line of inquiry on pipeline growth and sales organization (“*look at your sales pipeline… seeing growth… new sales leadership… broader macro backdrops*”), representing a clear re-anchoring of the interaction toward commercial momentum rather than program congestion risk.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Numeric cue hint indicates no numeric cues in either excerpt**, and the content transition is qualitative (concerns about “*delays*” and “*mindshare*” vs. an evaluative request to “*discern whether you're seeing growth*” and “*elaborate*” on pipeline contributions), without explicit quantitative disclosure in the change-point excerpts.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.326; delta_after = 0.425; slope_pattern = Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: The **assertive** cumulative-tone slope **steepens**, consistent with a higher-intensity accumulation phase in which the dialogue moves from an idiosyncratic risk query into a broader, structured pipeline-growth interrogation that invites more categorical positioning and segmentation (i.e., stronger “Accumulated Communication” momentum).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check shows local_max = 51**, indicating that the window contains bins with notably high quote-update activity.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +4.89744**, a positive deviation versus the pre-market session baseline.
- Pre-Market context: Given **limited liquidity baseline in pre-market**, an elevated quote-revision frequency (even without parallel increases in volume) is commonly observed alongside information processing and repositioning; spreads are expected to be more variable in this session.

## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension cautious)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure reflects an interactional pivot from a speculative operational-risk framing around VA EHR modernization delays (“*questions… going forward and delays… collateral damage… mindshare at VA*”) to a distinct follow-up focused on assessing pipeline growth and management capacity (“*sales pipeline… seeing growth… new sales leadership… macro backdrops*”), i.e., a new evaluative thread rather than continuation of the prior risk concern.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **No numeric cues are present before or after** per the provided hint, and both excerpts remain qualitative; the post-change question introduces uncertainty only in the sense of interpretive difficulty (“*trying to discern*”) rather than presenting measurable figures.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = -0.07; delta_after = -0.065; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: The **cautious** cumulative-tone slope remains **stable** (slightly less negative), suggesting no marked intensification of risk-hedging language at the change point; the accumulated communication intensity in the cautious dimension appears largely unchanged as the topic shifts.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max = 51** (local peak check), consistent with concentrated quoting activity within the window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Bid_Ask_Spread local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.0717328** (reporting the deviation magnitude only; dispersion is particularly relevant in pre-market where wider spreads are expected).
- Pre-Market context: In **pre-market**, modest widening in spread relative to baseline and elevated quote revisions can be meaningful given the **thin-liquidity benchmark**, even when trade volume deviations are not positive.

## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure is the movement from an “oddball” external-program dependency question (“*Cerner… EHR modernization… delays… collateral damage*”) to a more growth-oriented interaction about pipeline trajectory and organizational capability (“*sales pipeline… discern whether you're seeing growth… trending higher… elaborate*”), which reframes the conversation from downside speculation to expansion assessment (without explicit guidance language in the excerpts).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False**, and the excerpts are qualitative; the after-excerpt uses evaluative terms (“*growth… trending higher*”) rather than hard metrics.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.589; delta_after = 0.565; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: The **optimistic** accumulation is **stable** (slightly lower positive increment), indicating that the change point does not coincide with a clear acceleration in upbeat language intensity; instead, optimism appears to persist at a similar rate as the discussion transitions into pipeline commentary.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max = 51** (local peak check), reflecting intermittent high quote-update bins in the local window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Count local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.406429**, indicating slightly higher trade counts relative to the session baseline (noting pre-market’s low baseline levels).
- Pre-Market context: With **limited pre-market liquidity**, small positive deviations in trade count can be salient when interpreted relative to the baseline dispersion, particularly when accompanied by elevated quote revision activity.

## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension specific)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure is a topical reset from VA/Cerner modernization delay concerns (“*process going forward and delays*”) to a pipeline-growth diagnostic request (“*trying to… discern whether you're seeing growth… Attain added… trending higher*”), shifting the interaction from program-execution conjecture to commercial pipeline decomposition.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **No numeric cues are flagged in either excerpt**, and the post-change query seeks qualitative decomposition (“*can you… elaborate*”) rather than enumerated pipeline figures within the excerpted change-point boundary.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.799; delta_after = 0.825; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: The **specific** cumulative-tone increment is **stable to marginally higher**, suggesting that the granularity/technicality level remains consistently elevated across the transition, compatible with a move into detailed pipeline discussion while maintaining comparable “Accumulated Communication” intensity in specificity.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Bid_Ask_Spread range in local stats is min = -2 to max = 2** (dispersion/range only, given negatives), indicating substantial spread variability within the local window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Order_Book_Imbalance local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -0.0619028**, reflecting a modest negative shift relative to baseline in the imbalance measure.
- Pre-Market context: In **pre-market**, order-book measures and spreads can be noisy due to thinner depth; therefore, deviations are typically interpreted relative to the limited-liquidity baseline rather than in absolute magnitude.

## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension clear)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure is a shift from an unconventional, potentially uncertainty-laden probe (“*question from left field… delays… collateral damage*”) to a structured clarification-oriented follow-up on pipeline trend and segmentation (“*trying to… discern… can you… talk about… elaborate*”), indicating a reset toward interpretive clarity demands rather than continuing the prior thread.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: The **numeric cue hint is false for both sides**, and the excerpts emphasize qualitative clarification requests and scenario framing (pipeline “*ups and downs*,” “*trending higher*”) rather than concrete numeric disclosure.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.807; delta_after = 0.868; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: The **clear** dimension shows **stable-to-slightly higher** accumulation, consistent with continued clarity-oriented communication intensity as the dialogue moves into a question that explicitly asks management to “*talk about*” and “*elaborate*” on pipeline structure.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Quote_Volatility local stats max = 41.714** (within the local window’s observed bins), indicating that volatility proxy values can reach moderate levels during the window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -0.859791**, suggesting slightly lower quote-volatility on average versus the session baseline during the local window.
- Pre-Market context: In **pre-market**, volatility proxies and spreads exhibit higher dispersion and intermittent observations; a modest negative deviation in quote volatility can still co-occur with heightened quoting activity, consistent with heterogeneous liquidity conditions.

## Change Point at Transcript 2951.782s (and Dimension relevant)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: **topic boundary.**
- The tracked departure reflects a move from an off-template operational concern regarding VA/Cerner delays (“*questions… delays… collateral damage*”) to a core valuation-relevant commercial question about pipeline trajectory and acquisition contribution (“*sales pipeline… how much maybe Attain added… trending higher*”), representing a reorientation toward business development relevance rather than external-program distraction.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: **Before/after numeric cue flags are false**, and the excerpt boundary contains qualitative relevance framing (pipeline contribution, leadership, macro “*ups and downs*”) without explicit figures.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before = 0.827; delta_after = 0.97; slope_pattern = Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity).**
- Interpret: The **relevant** dimension remains **stable with a larger positive increment**, consistent with an elevated salience of the discussion as it transitions into a pipeline-focused question; this corresponds to sustained accumulation in relevance-oriented communication intensity.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available.**
  - One local observation: **Trade_Count local stats max = 48** (local window), indicating that the window contains bins with comparatively high trade clustering even in pre-market.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -17.9696**, indicating that average traded shares are lower than the pre-market baseline despite other activity measures showing positive deviations.
- Pre-Market context: The combination of **lower average trade volume** with **elevated quote revisions** is consistent with pre-market microstructure where liquidity is limited and information processing may be reflected more in quoting dynamics than in sustained large-size execution.
