## Change Point at Transcript 611.953s (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **Yes.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance.
  - “**will drive summer flight schedules**”
  - “**anticipated demand this summer**”
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The narrative shifts from a backward-/benchmark-oriented macro forecast framing (“**2021 revenue passenger miles will be 57% below 2019**”) toward near-term demand outlook and planning language tied to summer scheduling (“**will drive summer flight schedules**”).

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.
  - Numeric cue hint indicates **Before_has_numeric_cue=True** versus **After_has_numeric_cue=False**.
  - The “before” excerpt contains a quantified comparison (“**57% below 2019**”), whereas the “after” excerpt relies on qualitative/forward-looking adoption and intent (“**announced domestic wide-body routes**” to meet “**anticipated demand**”).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=1.0; delta_after=-1e-05; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: **Flattening** is consistent with a moderation in incremental tone momentum, indicating reduced marginal “information injection intensity” in the cumulative tone trajectory immediately after the change point, relative to the pre-change acceleration.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- Local Market Evidence Status is **Available**:
  - ONE local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local peak check shows local_max=38** within the event window.
  - ONE deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -8.28182**, indicating lower quote-update intensity locally than the Regular-session baseline average, while **Quote_Volatility shows +29.7741** above baseline.
- Regular-session context: In **Regular** trading, baseline activity is typically higher and more variable; relative to that backdrop, the local window exhibits **below-baseline quote revision frequency** alongside **above-baseline quote volatility**, with **Trade_Volume deviation negative (-47.9051)** and **Trade_Count deviation modestly positive (+0.153554)**, consistent with dispersed but not unusually elevated transaction intensity versus the session norm.
