## Change Point at Transcript 2205.134s (and Dimension assertive)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **procedural transition**.
- Why tracked: The dialogue moves from substantive historical/contextual detail on index-linked contracts to an interactional handoff/uncertainty about who can answer the legacy-cycle comparison, as reflected in: “**I just don't have the detail in front of me** …” followed by “**Scott, you want to take a stab at it or should I move on?**” and “**I joined in 2016**.”

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Hard→Soft**.
- Justification: The “before” side contains contract mechanics with numeric structure (“**in most cases, like 80% of that increase or drop is pushed back to the customer**”), whereas the “after” side is primarily capacity-to-answer/procedural (“**I joined in 2016**”), indicating a move away from verifiable contract parameters toward speaker-position information.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.373; delta_after=0.029; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: Within the **assertive** dimension, the slope flattening is consistent with a marked reduction in accumulated communication intensity (i.e., less incremental assertive content being injected immediately after the change point).

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=70** within the stated window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +150.583 shares** (also **Trade_Count = +1.09445**).
- Regular-session context: Given the **Regular** market session baseline with higher typical activity, the noted positive deviations are best interpreted as **modest incremental activity relative to an already active baseline**, and the Bid–Ask Spread should be treated in terms of **dispersion/range** only (negatives present), rather than sign interpretation.

## Change Point at Transcript 1360.354s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **topic boundary**.
- Why tracked: The Q&A shifts from hurricane-related supply/logistics risk granularity (“**still congestion in the ports and all the logistics change** … **bumpy couple-week road**”) to pricing pass-through confidence framing (“**ability and confidence to pass through price** …”), indicating a tracked departure from near-term disruption assessment to commercial/pricing execution.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Numeric cues are absent on both sides (Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False). The “before” emphasizes qualitative risk assessment (“**too early to tell**,” “**could be a bumpy couple-week road**”), and the “after” emphasizes qualitative confidence and positioning (“**we've been successful in getting price**,” “**not a margin grab**”), remaining primarily non-quantitative.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.319; delta_after=0.26; slope_pattern=Similar slope (stable accumulation intensity)**.
- Interpret: Within the **optimistic** dimension, the similar slope indicates **stable accumulated communication intensity**, consistent with a continuation of optimism-toned framing while rotating across topics.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=60** in the local window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +0.702237** (and **Quote_Revision_Frequency = +2.03495**).
- Regular-session context: In a **Regular** session, the combination of higher-than-baseline quote volatility and quote updating frequency is **temporally aligned** with this topic boundary, while trade volume deviation is **near baseline/slightly lower** (**Trade_Volume = -0.566116**), suggesting the response is more visible in quotes than in executed volume in this window.

## Change Point at Transcript 1836.921s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- Classification: **procedural transition**.
- Why tracked: The segment transitions from forward-leaning but still substantive commodity/price discussion (“**stabilization going into the end of this year and early next year** … **profitability will be better next year**”) to call/analyst wrap-up language (“**Thanks, guys. Good luck through the rest of the year**”), marking a tracked move from content delivery to conversational closure.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft**.
- Justification: Numeric cues are absent in the hint (False→False). The “before” is qualitative forward-leaning assessment with uncertainty (“**anybody's guess**,” “**we do think**”), and the “after” is procedural courtesy (“**Thanks**”), remaining non-quantitative throughout.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.593; delta_after=0.162; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition)**.
- Interpret: Within the **optimistic** dimension, the post-change-point flattening indicates a **meaningful deceleration** in accumulated communication intensity, consistent with the shift into a wrap-up where fewer optimism-toned informational increments are added.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Local Market Evidence Status: **Available**.
  - One local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=70** in the local window.
  - One deviation-table highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +160.321 shares** (with **Trade_Count = +2.44993**).
- Regular-session context: Against a **Regular** session baseline (higher typical liquidity), the positive trade-count and trade-volume deviations are **notable but should be scaled as incremental** rather than exceptional; Bid–Ask Spread should be summarized via **dispersion/range** only given negative values in the series.
