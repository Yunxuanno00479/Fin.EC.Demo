## Change Point at Transcript Unavailable (and Dimension Unavailable)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Unavailable.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts. **Unavailable — no Change Point packets (and no excerpted Q&A text) were provided for the QA segment, so no tracked departure can be documented at any transcript second.**

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Unavailable.**
- Justification: **Unavailable in provided data** (no Change Point packet content/excerpts and no numeric cue at a detected inflection in QA).

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before: Unavailable; delta_after: Unavailable; slope_pattern: Unavailable.**
- Interpret: **Unavailable — the provided data state that no Q&A change points were detected across all dimensions, so no dimension-specific pre/post slope contrast (Accumulated Communication intensity) can be computed from Change Point packets.**

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- **Local Market Evidence Status: Unavailable** — reason: **No Change Point packets were detected/provided for Q&A, hence no local evidence or local-vs-baseline deviation blocks exist to reference.**
- **Session baseline context (Pre-Market):** Liquidity is typically limited relative to Regular session, so even low absolute trade activity may be meaningful relative to baseline; spreads are often wider and more variable. In this call’s Pre-Market panel baseline, central tendencies indicate **Trade_Count median = 1 trade/bin** and **Trade_Volume median ≈ 19 shares/bin (0.000019M)**, while dispersion is wide (e.g., **Trade_Count max = 62**, **Trade_Volume max = 7,331 shares (0.007331M)**). For quotes, **Quote_Revision_Frequency median = 11** (max 53) and **Quote_Volatility median = 3.519** (max 56.246). For **Bid_Ask_Spread**, values include negatives in the baseline (min −2, max 2), so only dispersion/range is reportable rather than sign interpretation.
