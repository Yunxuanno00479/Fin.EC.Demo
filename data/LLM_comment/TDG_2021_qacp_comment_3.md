## Change Point at Transcript 1667.371s (and Dimension optimistic)

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Procedural transition.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet marks a handoff from a closed exchange (“**Q: Okay. Thanks again. | A: Yep.**”) into a new analyst prompt requesting international mix/China context (“**China just being a watch item… international kind of sales mixes… break it down by region**”), constituting a tracked reset in the Q&A interaction flow rather than a continuation of the immediately preceding dialogue.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False. The shift is framed as qualitative inquiry (“**comment on China… watch item… sales mixes… break it down by region**”) rather than a quantified disclosure in the excerpted transition.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.358; delta_after=0.029; slope_pattern=Flattening (stabilization/procedural transition).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  **Flattening** in the optimistic cumulative tone suggests **reduced dimension-specific information injection intensity**, consistent with a procedural reset between Q&A turns rather than an escalation in optimistic content.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.  
    - Local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=45** within the provided window.  
    - Deviation highlight: **Quote_Volatility local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = -86.1459** (lower local volatility proxy than the session baseline).
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  As this occurs in the **Regular session** (higher baseline activity and tighter competition for attention), the local window shows **lower volatility and slightly lower quote-revision frequency versus baseline** (QRF deviation **-1.69328**) alongside a **modestly higher Trade_Count deviation (+0.383712)**, indicating responses that are present but not unusually elevated relative to typical regular-session dispersion.

### A. Structural Inflection (Tracking) — Required
- Past→Future shift? **No.**
- If Yes: quote the phrase(s) indicating forward-looking guidance. **Unavailable.**
- If No: classify the shift as one of {topic boundary, procedural transition, risk management pivot, metric disclosure}. **Topic boundary.**
- One sentence explaining why this is a tracked departure from the prior narrative trajectory, based on excerpts.  
  The packet transitions from analyst probing on intra-quarter aftermarket trend discernment (“**broad-based… lumpiness… any trend to discern… April… May… June**”) to a new question on business-jet demand composition (“**leisure oriented… individually owned aircraft… corporate fleets… translating to… aftermarket sales**”), representing a tracked shift in discussion focus across distinct demand drivers.

### B. Soft vs Hard Information Shift — Required
- Label: **Soft→Soft.**
- Justification: cite numeric cue hint + excerpt evidence.  
  **Numeric cue hint:** Before_has_numeric_cue=False; After_has_numeric_cue=False. Both sides of the transition are framed as qualitative interpretation prompts (trend discernment; composition of leisure vs corporate usage) without numeric anchoring in the excerpted change-point boundary.

### C. Accumulated Communication Intensity — Required
- Report slope proxy: **delta_before=0.157; delta_after=0.423; slope_pattern=Steepening (higher information injection intensity).**
- Interpret: steepening/flattening/stable as information injection intensity (Accumulated Communication).  
  The **steepening** in the optimistic cumulative tone indicates **higher dimension-specific accumulated communication intensity** immediately after the boundary, consistent with the interaction moving into a fresher, more expansionary discussion segment (new topic framing) rather than incremental clarification of the prior “lumpiness” line of questioning.

### D. Local Responses vs Session Baseline — Required
- Focus ONLY on the provided Local Evidence and Local-vs-Baseline Deviation.
- If Local Market Evidence Status is Available:
  - Cite ONE local observation (e.g., QRF local peak check) and ONE deviation-table highlight.  
    - Local observation: **Quote_Revision_Frequency local_max=34** within the provided window.  
    - Deviation highlight: **Trade_Volume local_mean_minus_baseline_mean = +36.6441** (higher local trade volume than the session baseline).
- Always contextualize magnitude using Market Session (After-Hours vs Regular vs Pre-Market).  
  In the **Regular session**, where baseline trading and quoting are comparatively higher, the local window shows **higher volume** alongside **lower quote volatility proxy** (deviation **-40.5013**) and **slightly lower quote-revision frequency** (deviation **-1.61607**), i.e., volume responses are observed alongside comparatively muted quote-based turbulence relative to the regular-session baseline distribution.
