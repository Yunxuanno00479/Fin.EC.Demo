### 1) Q&A Focus (4–6 bullets)

- Detailed discussion of C‑band spectrum outcomes and implications for carrier CapEx, small-cell deployments, and timing of associated demand.
- Clarification of DAC deployment cadence, testing/qualification steps, and expected order flow over the next two to three quarters.
- Assessment of the distribution channel as a recurring-revenue baseline, including scale (per-quarter run-rate) and inventory/replenishment dynamics.
- Targeted questions on SG&A (approx. 200k sequential increase), PPP/tax accounting effects, and the cash flow statement.
- Extensive focus on M&A: likelihood and timing of a transaction in the current fiscal year, desired product/capability adjacency, and board-level M&A governance.
- Forward-looking revenue framing: sequential quarter‑over‑quarter growth path for fiscal 2021 and reaffirmation of the longer-term ambition toward a much larger revenue scale.

### 2) Multi-dimensional Accumulated Communication

- Across the Q&A window (approximately 1,440–2,728 seconds), cumulative **assertive** tone rises steadily (from 0.5 to about 5.0), indicating a consistent, moderately firm stance throughout the exchange.
- **Optimistic** cumulative tone also increases almost monotonically (from about 0.66 to ~4.93), co-occurring with management’s emphasis on backlog strength, expected order acceleration, and a longer-term $100m revenue milestone.
- **Specific** cumulative tone shows a particularly strong and persistent upward trajectory (from ~0.96 to ~5.85), reflecting repeated provision of concrete details (e.g., order timing, distribution run-rates, target deal profiles).
- **Cautious** cumulative tone remains slightly negative and relatively flat (from about −0.06 to ~−0.87), suggesting limited reliance on caveats or downside framing compared with the more dominant assertive and optimistic trajectories.
- There is a noticeable **divergence between specific vs cautious slopes**: specific tone builds strongly and steadily, while cautious tone drifts only mildly further negative. This divergence indicates that, over the course of the Q&A, increasingly granular guidance and strategy detail is temporally aligned with only modest incremental caution.
- Cumulative **clear** and **relevant** scores climb throughout (clear from ~0.91 to ~10.63; relevant from ~0.97 to ~11.94), consistent with a Q&A that remains highly focused on material topics (deployment timing, M&A, revenue trajectory) and is articulated in a straightforward manner.

### 3) Phase-level Local Responses vs Session Baseline (After-Hours)

Context: After-Hours trading generally exhibits low liquidity, thin depth, and wider spreads. Even modest variations in activity around the Q&A window can therefore be meaningful relative to this lower baseline.

Using the Q&A phase window (approximately 16:52:59–17:17:27 ET):

- **Bid_Ask_Spread**
  - Local mean: ~0.18 vs baseline mean ~0.27 (local–baseline ≈ −0.09).
  - Within-sample dispersion is moderate (std ~0.11, range 0.09–0.35), but spreads are on average somewhat tighter than the broader After-Hours baseline, which already reflects relatively wide conditions.
  - Interpretation: During the Q&A, quoted spreads remain wide in absolute After-Hours terms but are observed to be slightly narrower than the session average.

- **Order_Book_Imbalance**
  - Local mean: about −0.38 vs baseline mean ~−0.29 (difference ≈ −0.09).
  - Range spans from about −0.67 to +0.33, indicating substantial dispersion between buy‑ and sell‑side depth over the window.
  - Interpretation: The Q&A interval is associated with somewhat more negative average imbalance and relatively wide swings in depth conditions, consistent with thin After-Hours liquidity.

- **Quote_Revision_Frequency**
  - Local mean: 2.0 vs baseline mean ~1.92 (difference ≈ +0.08).
  - Local maximum of 3 revisions per bin, slightly above the baseline maximum of 5 for the full session but at the higher end of the observed local range (1–3).
  - Interpretation: Quote update activity during Q&A is broadly similar to the After-Hours baseline, with a mild elevation and an observable local peak, but not an extreme departure.

- **Quote_Volatility**
  - Local mean: ~0.49 vs baseline mean ~0.42 (difference ≈ +0.07), with local values ranging from 0.06 to 0.83.
  - The upper end of the local range matches the session maximum, suggesting that the Q&A window includes some of the more volatile quote intervals in this After-Hours sample.
  - Interpretation: Within the inherently low-liquidity After-Hours environment, the Q&A phase coincides with slightly higher average quote volatility and includes bins at the top of the day’s observed range.

- **Trade_Count**
  - Local mean: 2 trades per bin vs baseline mean ~1.47 (difference ≈ +0.53).
  - Local dispersion is non-trivial (std ~1.0; range 1–3 trades).
  - Interpretation: The Q&A window is associated with somewhat higher trading incidence per bin than the broader After-Hours baseline, although absolute trade counts remain low in level terms.

- **Trade_Volume**
  - Local mean: ~185 shares per bin vs baseline mean ~240 shares (difference ≈ −55).
  - The local range (46–379 shares) is nested within the baseline dispersion, and volumes remain small, as expected After-Hours.
  - Interpretation: Despite a modestly higher frequency of trades, average per‑bin traded volume during Q&A is somewhat below the broader session mean, consistent with fragmented, low-size executions typical of limited-liquidity periods.

Overall, within an After-Hours context characterized by low baseline liquidity and wide spreads, the Q&A phase is temporally aligned with:
- Slightly **tighter spreads**,
- Somewhat **more negative and volatile order-book imbalances**,
- **Mildly elevated quote volatility and trade incidence**, and
- **Lower average per-bin trade volumes** relative to the broader session.
