Davidson & Co.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter here. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the Quest business. You know, I think you were surprised as you acquired the business, kind of the expandability of it, you know, kind of the performance and some of these adjacencies that were rolled out. Clearly, that appears to continue to be a catalyst As we see bars as a category sort of underperform, how quickly and how much of a focus is, you know, expanding into the chips, the cookies, you know, some of the frozen products, et cetera, the adjacencies for Quest that seem to be doing quite well?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, good morning, Brian. It's a good question. You know, I think, first of all, we had high expectations of the Quest business when we bought it. and it has exceeded our expectations over the past year. The question you're asking about is around the balance between the protein bar business at Quest and the all other forms. And I think it's important that we stay focused on ensuring that the bar business continues to recover and starts growing. And the metric I would point to is unlike the Atkins business, the Quest business overall brand awareness is still relatively low. For the most part, Most households in the United States are not familiar with the Quest brand. So the job from a brand standpoint is to continue to build brand awareness and get the brand better known. The easiest avenue to do that is through the protein bar business, which is the largest, most important part of the business. So you should expect us to continue to focus on that. That said, Alternative forms, especially right now when at-home consumption is more important, is an important component to the brand. So focusing on the chips, the cookies, and now the confections on that business helps us introduce the brand, build brand awareness, and drive consumption in at-home. So I think you should see us continue to balance between those two things because we believe that there's upside growth in the bar form as well as the alternative forms.",positive,0.654,neutral,0.654,positive,0.764,positive,0.893,positive,0.924,positive,0.964,1,0.654,0.0,0.764,0.893,0.924,0.964,0.654,0.0,0.764,0.893,0.924,0.964,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can you just remind us, you know, starting from a lower gross margin base, you know, product mix, et cetera, where we are in the integration of that asset and thinking about the synergies flowing through this year and any changes as far as opportunities there to take costs out of that business or get those margins back up comparable to legacy Atkins?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so this is Todd. The margins are we're seeing improvement on the Quest side. They are definitely getting a bit closer to the legacy Atkins business, so we're probably about two points below from a gross margin perspective. Some of the synergies have kicked in from a logistics standpoint. We're starting to see some of those benefits. We have a number of other projects from a supply chain perspective that will kick in later in the year. So I think we'll continue to see some progress against those gross margins. Again, just the business channels that it's in, some of the forms that are in long-term, it's probably always going to be a little bit less than legacy Atkins, but we're definitely making some progress. I'll leave it there. I apologize, everyone. Okay. As a follow-up to that, given the size of the bar business in both of the brands, it tends to be the more profitable form from a company standpoint.

Please proceed with your question.,Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, good morning, folks. Happy New Year, and congrats on the improving sales momentum throughout the quarter. I guess let's pick up where you just left off on margins. Looking out to 2Q, I get that 2Q is sequentially always a bit of a margin step down from 1Q given seasonality. But questions in the prior year base, why are we going to flip to so much margin compression year on year, at least based at the midpoint of your guidance? Yeah, I don't think we're going to have a lot of margin compression from a Q2 to Q2 perspective. We'll have potentially a little bit, depending on where the product and channel mix comes in. But I think the margins should be relatively in line with last Q2. From Q1 to Q2, as we talk about, Q2 is always the lowest gross margin and EBITDA margin. quarter for us just because of the heavy, intensive merchandising that occurs in this quarter. But year over year, we should be fairly similar. Are you referring to gross margin or EBITDA margin? I'm referring to gross margin. Okay. I think your guidance, and maybe I need to go back and check my math, but the midpoint of your guidance for the first half, and obviously we can back out one cue, implies the EBITDA margin. would be down year on year. Is there something happening in the belly of the P&L, like stepped up SG&A, or maybe it's just maybe I need to go back and check on that. Yeah, slight increase in the SG&A rate is what we're rejecting. A little bit on the marketing side, so we're going to see a little bit of a bump up in marketing. We will see G&A as a percent a little bit higher. We just have some projects going on there, which will have some increased And from quarter to quarter here, it always bumps up in the second quarter as the start of the new year. We get pay increases. FICA taxes start to, you know, kick in again. So the G&A always tends to be a bit higher in Q2 as well. So, again, gross margin should be similar. EBITDA margins may be a little bit lower, but no significant changes. Okay. And with most of the shelf resets either behind you or good visibility to them, Can you give us an update on how you believe your share of shelf has changed? Yeah, Jason, we had a good fall reset season. So far, early returns, right, you got to see consumption. But for the most part, it's consumption that gives you visibility to TDP growth. So both brands growing TDPs in the high single to low double digits on a percentage basis. So we did pretty well. Now it all comes down to how productive those items are and how incremental those items are to really understand the impact on consumption. So we need January, February, March to better understand that. As you know, November, December are low-consumption months, and so you don't want to read too much into early reads. But for the most part, most of our new products, offtake has been pretty positive early. We want to see a little bit more data before we ??before we feel good about that. Got it. Good stuff.

Nice quarter there. I just had a question. Hi. Just a follow-on to Jason's question. As I think about you had some nice shelf space wins. Thank you for quantifying the TDPs there. I'm just curious to how you define the competitive situation in your categories and, you know, what you're seeing from other big brands that might be competing with Atkins and Quest. And if I could also add to that or maybe get some perspective on kind of the new products and how those are contributing to your sales growth. You have a pretty good new product lineup. You know, is there sort of an incremental contribution you could help define from those new products?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, talking about ourselves first, still really early innings from a consumption of new items. So we just look at kind of week-to-week velocities. Offtake appears to be pretty good. So the peanut butter cup, the lemon bar on Quest, both performing well. On Atkins, the iced coffee shakes and the Engulge dessert bars, all off to pretty good starts. But again, November, December are typically soft consumption months, so you don't want to read too much into that. But Overall, we feel pretty good about the start. It looks like, and I'll steal a little bit of Jason's theory, but I think retailers are coming back, you know, kind of in a COVID environment, supporting bigger brands, it appears. So in our category, it looks like that Premier has done pretty well. Clearly, Atkins and Quest have done pretty well. I don't really look at the bar set. It appears that Kind has done pretty well most recently from a bar standpoint. So it looks like maybe retailers have invested in leadership brands in order to drive the category kind of in this COVID environment.

Are you seeing a stronger performance in the mass channel versus, say, grocery? And does that relate to retailers getting behind some of these big brands? Is that going to help at a large retailer, for example, kind of help to push your performance there?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, during the quarter and in the early part of Q2, in general, mass got a little bit better. So steadily improved their performance, I think, based upon the fact they got behind the bigger brands and their consumption improved. So in general, our business got better in mass. In general, mass business relative to other channels got better. So we saw kind of steady incremental improvement. Even the bar business in mass got a little bit better. So I think coming out of the fall resets, mass in general improved their position and Obviously, they were leaking market share for a while. They're starting to move in the right direction. And that's obviously, given our development in mass, that's important to us. Shopper traffic got a little bit better, but we didn't see significant improvements in shopper traffic yet. We haven't seen that yet.

I guess going back to Quest and the peanut butter cups specifically, still very early days, but the Nielsen takeway looks very good. It looks like annualized is running around $9 million or so. I'm wondering, Joe, if you could speak to the launch, you know, what sort of expectations you have for ACV as F21 progresses, you know, moving outside of Target. And then also, you know, how aggressive are you with this product in e-com, non-measured channels? And, you know, how do you expect the marketing and distribution push will compare, you know, coming out of the gate relative to the cookies when they launched a few years ago? Thanks.",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, actually, I haven't looked at it relative to cookies. I think in general, peanut butter cups will build faster just because of the organization that's now driving it, right? The legacy SMPL organization, probably a little bit faster than building food drug mass distribution. And historically, within a year, 12 months of launching a new product, we can get it pretty close to 50% ACV through drug masks. So I wouldn't, you know, I think that's a reasonable target from a 12-month standpoint. It is performing exceptionally well in e-commerce. And, you know, we have pretty high expectations. Confections is a different use occasion. different need state than the existing business. It has proven, in particular, peanut butter cups in general have proven to be, whether it be on Atkins or on SlimFast, to be a pretty compelling item. So we have pretty high expectations for it, and it's off to a pretty good start. So we're very optimistic about it. And again, it ties back to use case and need state, and it brings in new consumers to the brand because it's a different It's a different type of product and appeals to a different consumer. So we're pretty optimistic. And, yeah, I'm sorry, I don't have that comparison to cookies. I'd have to go back and look at the build-out from the Legacy Quest business. I expect we'll do better, frankly. Yeah, I just want to follow on to that. Just want to follow on to that. I mean, it's off to a really strong start in C-Store as well. C-Store team has done a really nice job getting distribution. We'll continue to get distribution.

I think just to follow up briefly on the shelf sets, obviously autumn was the big shelf reset period for you. Very, very successful. not to get ahead of ourselves, but as you kind of think across the next 12 months, the resets that still have yet to come in the market, was there anything discreet that benefited you in this August reset period that may suggest future resets may not be as successful?

So we could, you know, we, you know, we don't like to talk about what might happen in our business going forward. We feel really good about our product pipeline. We said that before this reset, I continue to like the innovation that's coming on both brands. We feel good about our position and, from an innovation standpoint. And after all, it's the ideas that you have and the ability to attract consumers that attract customers to want to add our items. I think there appears to be a move to drive leadership brands in order to drive the category, so that appears to play to us in that we've got two of the bigger brands in the set, so I feel good about that.

Hi. Good morning, and congratulations from me also. So I wanted to get some perspective on the back half, even though you're not providing an outlook. But if I look at your results this quarter, you weren't actually that far away from what we were expecting a year ago in this quarter on the top line and actually better on EBITDA. So it seems that in some ways you've been able to offset on-the-go weakness by accelerating these other forms that we've been talking about and maybe even accelerating e-commerce. So just wanted to get a sense from you, how would you frame the uncertainty or the risks and opportunities when things hopefully normalize in the back half, especially in light of easy comps?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so, wow, great question. To tell you the truth, we haven't given much thought to the second half of the year at this point. You know, I'll talk to it as, you know, from a perspective of brand by brand. If you look at the Atkins business, the fiscal year 2020 softness was almost exclusively driven by our inability to grow new buyers at the rate that we were accustomed to. And if you then multiply their volume input into the business in the second half of the year, that was our miss from a volume standpoint. Probably the most encouraging thing in the first quarter was Atkins grew new buyers for the first time since the pandemic That's a very encouraging sign. That means people are engaging to some degree back in the category and back into the brand. The opportunity in the quarter was buy rate, so we just didn't drive as much buy rate, and that has to do with the large component of our business in bars and the away-from-home consumption element of bars. I think if I would summarize on Atkins the second half of the year, there's two simple questions. Can we continue to bring new buyers to the brand at the rate we saw in the first quarter? And then can we improve on the buy rate? And obviously, that's the big uncertainty, both from a new buyer as well as a retained buyer. If we can get the buy rate back up, I think we can have, obviously, a good back half of the year. I want to see a little bit more data. It's a little dangerous to read a quarter of data from a panel buy rate standpoint is just a little dangerous because it's just not a lot of data at this point. But that's how I would characterize Atkins, right? Can we get buy rate up? Can the bars start to improve? And can we get back closer to historic numbers? On Quest, I think, you know, the one comparison in Quest is, you know, prior to COVID, the business started to step up its growth in the second half of the year. And obviously COVID slowed that down for a bit. But we saw more aggressive comps on Quest. So can we continue? And then, obviously, a big bar business, buy rate on Quest becomes really important. You know, can we grow through, you know, the challenges and away from home consumption? So for us, the big metric in the second half of the year is going to be what's mobility look like? How does it impact bars? And then how does that impact buy rate on both businesses as we go forward? I think the other metrics that we can control, which is share of shelf, marketing, media investment, I think will do the right things there. The overhang will be, you know, how does the vaccine roll out? How does it improve mobility?

And then as I think about sort of, again, these other forms, I mean, it doesn't sound like that's where the concern is. Like, it seems that you can continue to grow that business. You're not worried about the sustainability of trends in those forms, even as mobility increases. Is that the right way to characterize it?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"They tend to be, particularly chips and confections, tend to be more at-home consumptions. So less affected by the pandemic. There's white space on both of those forms, so we have the ability to fill out white space. Consumption continues to be good. The job in Quest is to build brand awareness, consideration, and trial. Again, from a two-business standpoint, if you just step back and look at the marketing challenges, on Atkins, everybody is aware of the brand. The job is to change their perspective on what the brand stands for. The job on Quest is to create brand awareness. It's still relatively low. We have a big, loyal consumer group on Quest, but still relatively low brand awareness outside that group. So your marketing pressure to continue to build awareness consideration and trial on that business, right? I'm trying to remember the unaided brand awareness. I don't think it's over 20% on Quest. So lots of opportunity on Quest to build awareness. All the forms matter, right? Bars matter as do the other forms. So we tend to define the issue much more from a consumer standpoint than a product and form standpoint. Got to build brand awareness on Quest. Got to continue to change people's points of view of what they believe on Atkins in order to grow household penetration.

So can I ask about pricing dynamics, particularly on the bars business? We only get visibility into the measured channel data, but Would I be right in thinking that you probably did have a pricing benefit at the net pricing line earlier in the pandemic, perhaps because of a pullback in promotional activity? And I'm just wondering with the step up in merchandising on particularly on the Quest side of things, is that going to lead to declines in pricing year on year as we look out through the course of 2021? And then I have a follow up.",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, I mean, the pricing benefit that we got from the pandemic was actually fairly short-lived. If you remember, we talked about on the last couple of calls, you know, retailers in our Q3, in that March to May time period, retailers really pushed out or cut promotional activities, you know, just to reduce the complexity in their stores. A lot of those fell into Q4, so we saw, you know, we saw some price realization benefit lower volume, but price ??realization benefit in Q3. That kind of flipped on the other side in Q4. Q1 of this year, kind of normal. We didn't see much of a change. We kind of have similar merchandising activity here in Q2 as well. So it was really just a short-term March to May time period for us where we got that price realization. So as we lap Q3, yeah, we'll probably see higher trade rates. in Q3 assuming mobility is okay and maybe a little bit of benefit in Q4 as we don't have as much as we kind of push together a bunch of activity in Q4.

So thank you for the the insights on the 12 pounds gained on average during the pandemic. I was wondering about that. I'm also wondering if your consumer insight data shows anything that could point to habits that have potentially changed permanently, you know, that could make weight loss look different when we emerge from the pandemic.

I just have observation that as mobility has improved, so has the consumption of our business. So, you know, I think that that is probably the big debate going on in food companies with larger food companies trying to convince folks that meals are going to come back in vogue and Moms are going to continue to cook. I just happen to think that, you know, frankly, convenience is always going to be an important consumer benefit, that our lives, whether we like it or not, are going to become hectic and time-challenged, as they were before and on the go. Nutritional consumption is going to become ever important, right? I just don't think... I just don't think that all of a sudden we're going to return to the 1950s and 1960s when it comes to eating meals. If you look at millennials, they actually almost don't see a difference between snacking and eating meals. In fact, they don't even see them as meals. So they're snacking as everyday eating, just as they see a meal. It's almost seamless between the two. I don't think that's changing either, quite frankly. You know, I'm pretty optimistic that just in our own behaviors as a business that when the pandemic's behind us, we're going back to the office because it's not as efficient to operate remotely. And with that will come a lot of the habits and practices that we had prior to the pandemic. My guess is that's going to be more true than not.

Please proceed with your questions.,Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for stopping me in. I apologize if I missed this in prepared remarks, but can you tell us what the organic sales growth was for both the Atkins brand and Quest brands? For the quarter, you'll see in the queue The Atkins was down about 10% largely due to the shift from Q1. And also we had some, due to the storms in Texas, we had a fair amount of shipments, particularly on the Atkins brand that kind of got held up in transit. That will come back in Q3. So versus a low single digits total consumption, timing of shipments was off a bit on Atkins. Quest, on the other hand, was up in the high teens. Okay. And I think I heard, Todd, I think I heard you mention in prepared remarks that that pull into Q1 out of Q2 was about two points on Atkins. Okay. So implying that this deferral of shipments into Q3 may actually be like an eight-point or larger type benefit for Atkins. Am I doing the math properly on that? Yes, it's probably not that much. We also pulled back with our new business model in Canada that affected the North American business for Atkins as well, so we lost a point or two there. So we lost a few points due to the storms. That will go right into Q3. And then we lost a little bit in Canada as well. Got it. That's helpful. And, Joe, quick question for clarification on ??on the outlook. In prepared remarks, you mentioned that your guidance is predicated on the current consumer mobility levels sort of holding steady rather than sequentially improving. But at the same time, right before that, you mentioned that you expect mobility to continue to improve. So I guess the question is, which is it? From your planning assumption, are you assuming stagnation on mobility or are you indeed expecting and planning for continued progress. Yeah, we're actually, the assumptions in our guidance for the second half of the year assumes status quo. Excellent. Thank you so much for the clarification. I'll pass it on.

Chris, I just had a question for you. As I think about the current state of your business, the current mobility and the sort of sales that's creating, at least in measure channels that we can track, and I realize we're not going to get the full picture because of the very strong growth in e-commerce, but it would seem to suggest against the really easy comps of the prior year, some very strong sales momentum in the third quarters. You go against those really easy comps in those kind of April and May in particular from the prior year. I just want to get a sense of how to think about the current rate of revenue, and again, in a world where you don't expect mobility to improve, should this general rate of sales hold, based on your assumptions? And is there any other considerations around that, like inventory movements, or we got a little bit of that just now from Jason's question, but also promotional timing, things that could distort it up or down in the coming quarters?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"They're probably helpful to think of it on a quarter basis, so historically, third quarter is a bigger quarter for us than fourth. So I would think, Chris, the kind of run rate you're seeing right now probably will be more like we'll see in the third quarter kind of week to week. And then we would expect some softening because we do see it historically in the fourth quarter just based upon kind of the seasonality of the business. And then you rightfully pointed out that we saw higher levels of inventory in transit at the end of the second quarter, which obviously just flow right into the third quarter. So I think that's probably helpful from just how to think about a run rate standpoint. And again, to Jason's question, we're assuming we learned a little bit about mobility, a little bit more specificity around mobility. And specifically, our brands correlate in particular bars into a lesser degree, correlate not to just consumption correlate not just to general mobility, but being at work and being in transit to work. So general mobility is a good benefit because it improves shopper traffic and in particular in mass, but we're really looking for people to get back to their normal lives and get back to work. And if you think about it, that makes a fair amount of sense. While we've been sitting at home, we are probably eating more meals and using our products less for meal replacement. When we start going back to work and in transit to work, fewer meal occasions, more products, in particular bars and shakes, used as a meal replacement and or snack while that works. So for us, mobility, understanding what mobility really means made us a little bit more cautious as we moved into the second half of the year because it seems like mobility is going to get better. But we really need people to get back to work. And for us, that felt like fourth quarter, first quarter next year before at least the U.S. gets back to that state. Okay, that's good color. Yeah, one other thing I would say, if you remember from last year when COVID hit in March, retailers really just kicked out or pulled off all their promotions. So we are lapping that now. We're kind of at a normalized promotional period for Q3 and also for Q4. So you're going to see, and if you remember last Q3, volume was way down, which was not helpful for us, obviously, but our margins, both at the gross margin and EBITDA margin, really benefited from that pullback in trade activity. So the profit held very, very nicely. We're going to see a bit of a reversal of that in Q3. I think we're going to have a very strong volume quarter as we lap Q3. We're also reinstating some trade so that we'll have a bit of a margin hit for the quarter. And then as you go into Q4, as we started to, especially on the Quest side, Quest had a very strong Q4. They snapped back very, very quickly. And we had pretty normal trade activity in the quarter. And so the trade impact should be pretty nominal in Q4, but there will be a Q3 impact.",positive,0.561,neutral,0.599,neutral,0.612,positive,0.931,positive,0.89,positive,0.969,2,0.561,0.0,0.0,0.931,0.89,0.969,0.998,0.0,0.0,1.899,1.775,1.9129999999999998,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi. My first question is around Atkins. I think we all know that there are two drivers that have impacted Atkins. One is maybe the weight management side of things, and the other is just reduced consumer mobility, as you talked about. And I'm wondering how you think about those two drivers, because you mentioned, you know, renewed consumer interest in weight management, and then you mentioned sort of, you know, return to work as two main components of, you know, bringing Atkins back to more normal levels. So we'd just love more perspective around how you think about those two drivers going forward.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, well, great question. You know, first, if you just track what's happened since COVID, third and fourth quarter on Atkins, we saw a dramatic fall off in people coming to the brand. So our new buyer growth post COVID through the end of our fiscal year was down dramatically, down double digits. And that impacted obviously total volume in the second half of the fiscal year on Atkins. Encouragingly, starting in September, and going through the second quarter, we've seen buyer flow, new buyers coming in, and loyalty among retained buyers at historic levels. So people started coming back to the brand and coming back to weight management pretty much timed with the beginning of our fiscal year. That's encouraging. That means interest in weight management, interest in the brand has been strong since the start of our fiscal year. So we feel pretty good that our marketing is working, our product innovation is working. And so the gap in volume on Atkins, if you think of it from a buyer standpoint, is just straight out buy rate. So how much people are consuming. And then that led us to a path of trying to understand what the driver of that is. And what we learned is there's a high correlation in bars and shakes on Atkins and bars on Quest around Atkins. being at work and being in transit. Fascinating, right? So what's driving Atkins' performance is not people's interest in weight management. It's flat out the number of occasions, kind of where I am and how much I snack, right? How much I'm using it as a meal replacement. And as I mentioned earlier, when I'm home, I'm eating more meals and I'm using... snack foods less as a meal replacement. And I might even snack less because I'm eating more regular meals because I'm home. As I start getting back and going back to work and taking the kids to school and going to sports, convenience becomes more important, my snacking behavior goes up, and I'm probably using our products more as a meal replacement. And you can see that by form. Bars and shakes, which tend to be more meal replacement oriented than snacking oriented, doing less well as people have not been at work and in transit. And then what we call the snackier portion of our portfolio, so chips and cookies and confections, they had no correlation whatsoever to location. So they are getting consumed at normal rates, and we would not expect any change in those forms as people return to work and work. return to their jobs and kids go back to school. So, you know, for us, very encouraging. Consumers are coming back to the brand. And as they get back to work, we're going to see buy rates go back.

I was wondering if you could just, like, as we think about, you know, the bar trends for Quest versus Atkins, I know we talked about this earlier on in the pandemic, how Quest was outperforming. So I'm wondering if you have any evolved thoughts on, you know, why sort of the Quest brand specifically within the bar product form is doing better than Atkins?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, less correlated. So it's interesting we now have the data less correlated to at work and at transit than Atkins is. So pretty interesting there. And then, too, some of the drivers of Quest, so some of the ??Distribution drivers, improving distribution in general, some innovation on bars that's really doing well. So Quest has done a slightly better job, less correlated to mobility and being at work, and some nice innovation in particular hero bars have done pretty well. So we've seen Quest do a little bit better from a bar standpoint. Obviously not where we want it to be, but certainly doing a little bit better than Atkins has during that period of time. I would say the last factor, Faiza, is Quest has always been over-indexed in e-commerce, and obviously that's the channel you wanted to be in in the last year, and they continue to perform exceptionally well, and so they have not been as reliant on brick and mortar.

My first question is actually just a follow-up to Faiza's line of questioning because, you know, obviously there's a lot being talked about in terms of maybe consumer behavior will have shifted permanently from COVID. I mean, I think every kid's going to go back to play soccer, but maybe not everybody's going back to the office and mobility won't be quite what it is. or was pre-pandemic. So do you think about that in the context of Atkins in terms of changing the messaging? I mean, we all see the ads a ton, but does it make sense to rethink the product assortment or the messaging from the ads in terms of, you know, trying to appeal to people if they are in fact going to end up staying home and be less mobile going forward?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, first, I would say a lot of that, you know, we've obviously participated in some of that conversation just as the CEO running a business. As soon as I can get people back to work, I'm getting them back to work because of loss of efficiency in the organization. So I think to some degree there's various points of view on that. I think the conversation is pretty overblown. So my first observation is it's going to be more the same pre-COVID, post-COVID than it is different, just an observation. Second, yeah, obviously ??We would adjust marketing. You're already starting to see on Quest development of what I would call everywhere, every time snacks. So the confections, the peanut butter cup confections, the chips and the cookies tend to behave differently than bars and shakes do. So the development of that portion of the franchise becomes very important in that it becomes less site-specific, less time-specific. Clearly Atkins has that development, the confections, but you'll see us starting to innovate in snacks that have less dependence upon kind of being at work and being in transit over time. That's obviously a second strategy, and we're pushing that strategy pretty well. But I got to tell you, I don't think you're going to see dramatic changes in work performance. I expect most companies will be back at work when they have the opportunity to get back to work. Exactly when that's going to happen is anyone's guess, but it's feeling like somewhere between the 4th of July and Labor Day, people start moving back to the office.",positive,0.65,neutral,0.605,neutral,0.612,positive,0.781,positive,0.842,positive,0.922,8,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.781,0.842,0.922,3.305,0.0,1.287,3.902,6.708,6.889,1,0,0,0,0,0

And then just on the commodity side, I know you called out a little bit of inflation, which is less than what a lot of the other food companies are talking about, and I know that's a function of the products you sell and the product mix and all of that. But can you talk about your sense of sort of the elasticity of demand to the extent inflation continues to creep up your willingness to raise prices, whether you think that will affect demand for the product, both on the Atkins and the Quest side.",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so we have not taken ??on Atkins, we have not taken a price increase in about four or five years.

You know, we're constantly looking at opportunities here. and running the elasticity models to see if we did take price, what would that impact be? We're very, very confident that we can execute a price increase and not only maintain strong volumes, but also obviously deliver the price realization that we need. We've been fortunate where we've been locked in. Our team has made some really nice bets on locking in commodities earlier in the year, and we've benefited from that. We're seeing a little bit more impact than we thought a couple months ago on some of the proteins, both dairy and soy, and we talked about inbound freight with higher diesel. Luckily, it's not much of an impact for this year, just a little bit more in the second half than we anticipated, but pretty nominal. If prices stay where they are right now, we'll probably have to do something, look at pulling some levers as we go into our next fiscal year. But we're doing the work right now on elasticity models.

Thanks so much. Maybe just a couple easy ones for me. I guess going back to the question just asked around cost inflation and some of the levers, just kind of more generally speaking, if I look at the company, namely Atkins, I guess historically, I don't feel like you really pulled the pricing lever much. It's been about attracting new buyers and you've obviously historically attracted a lot of buyers. It's all growth has been impressively driven by volumes. So as you think about just the cost equation vis-a-vis recovery, is that something you kind of sit there in a few months as you think forward next year and start to consider some pricing changes as long as the category seems to be pricing as well? Or do you kind of have to tiptoe through this to make sure that you're obviously capturing the full recovery as it comes. That's the first quick question.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Rob, I think, I think first, uh, our strategy is pretty simple. Maintain our, uh, maintain our gross margins as it, uh, in the marketplace. So we make significant marketing investments, maintaining our gross margins and slightly improving it with costs. Uh, savings opportunities is our longterm strategy. We have priced on Atkins when we've needed to from an inflation standpoint. So Todd's comment was one more of we've been managing inflation to neutral over the last few years and haven't had the need to do that. But if we see significant inflation, looks, feels inflationary as we move into fiscal 21, we wouldn't hesitate to price. Exactly externally what's going on, obviously it's easier when other people are pricing around you. uh, to sell on a price increase to customers. So those are always easier environments than leading. And, and it clearly some of that's going on right now, but we're justifying it. We would justify it based upon the fact that we're seeing inflation. We have a strategy of holding margins. We would, uh, we would be encouraging retailers to take price at retail, not to squeeze their own margins.

We're still doing the planning and executing for the fourth quarter, but we've got a top-notch sales team. We're really good at selling in display. I think one of the things retailers learned as part of COVID is that big brands matter in categories. Make sure you get those right. Make sure you get those brands on display to drive foot traffic into the aisle.

So really nothing on the trade, which has changed our view. It's really three components. One, slightly higher input costs, nothing significant, but a little bit of pressure there. Second one is brand mix. Quite frankly, Quest is growing significantly. much faster than Atkins right now. And as you know, Quest has slightly lower gross margins. So there's a bit of a brand or product mix impact there. And the third component, again, not huge, but a little bit of an impact, is channel mix. As brick and mortar has been slower to rebound than we had originally anticipated, EECOM has not slowed down. The fact that it accelerated in Q2 and we anticipate will be strong in the second half, that's been a little bit of a margin hit as well. Again, all three of those things individually are very, very small, but together, you know, a little bit of an impact for the year.",positive,0.525,neutral,0.692,neutral,0.632,positive,0.782,positive,0.923,positive,0.891,16,0.525,0.0,0.0,0.782,0.923,0.891,6.838,0.0,3.267,7.9990000000000006,13.452,13.956999999999999,0,0,1,0,0,0

Thanks, guys. Thanks for the question. Joe, in your prepared comments, you talked a little bit about reacceleration of foot traffic at the mass channel level. Can you give us a little bit of cadence? What is the rate of change? How quick is that? And then if you can, put that into some kind of historical perspective. Is traffic at the mass channel fast? You know, 80%, 85%, 90% of what it was pre-COVID. I suspect that that would be a big positive for Atkins, for the Atkins brand.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, big, you know, pretty much consistently through COVID, foot traffic, mass, down double digits. And they obviously were making it up in baskets, so bigger basket. But when people came to, let me step back. It's probably helpful to understand the total context. COVID, constrained people's shopping behavior by limiting the number of stores they visited and for the most part moved people down to smaller formats. So grocery tended to benefit more than mass did, right? So smaller stores versus bigger stores. And I think it was just, you know, safety concerns. So mass saw declines in foot traffic that pretty much didn't change throughout, you know, from the beginning of COVID to, through the second quarter of this year, foot traffic down. But because people were not eating out, obviously more meals, the basket when people were shopping were bigger. So retailers like Target, Walmart benefited from bigger baskets, but fewer shopping trips and fewer shoppers. So as we move into the third and fourth quarter, obviously those retailers start anniversaring those pretty significant declines in foot traffic. And we're starting... to see improving trends year on year. I would expect those trends to continue. Even without improvements in mobility, I would expect those trends just over easier comparables to improve, and that obviously benefits both of our brands, but it certainly benefits Atkins, given the importance of the mass channel to Atkins' business.",positive,0.601,neutral,0.696,positive,0.555,positive,0.931,positive,0.913,positive,0.968,17,0.601,0.0,0.555,0.931,0.913,0.968,7.439,0.0,3.822,8.93,14.365,14.924999999999999,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's really helpful in your clarity. So the final question is, and this question has already been asked in a different form, but It sounds like in your studies of buying patterns for Atkins, it sounds like you've learned something new about Atkins given the consumption patterns with driving to work or at work behavior. Again, does that change the way you market the brand a little bit? Rob Lowe is not necessarily someone that needs weight management control, so you've positioned it differently, but You know, you've learned something there. Does that change how you market the brand or position it?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, first I would say the mobility data was very helpful for both brands. So we understood, you know, our belief prior to the data was general mobility will help us. Well, we've learned now back to work, back to school, in transit, really important to bars and to a lesser degree shakes on both of our brands. That was an important component to it. So understanding that, obviously that's a consumer insight. And obviously, as we look to market our brands, we'll leverage that as an insight from a consumer standpoint. Absolutely. Rob, your question about Rob, we have changed the positioning of Atkins from a fast weight loss diet brand to a weight management brand. And we think Rob is the perfect embodiment of that. And the reason we did that was quite simple. The size of the target audience, about 8 million people. diet, fast weight loss consumers in the U.S., about 33 million weight management consumers in the U.S. interested in low-carb. So a much bigger target audience, and the brand has enjoyed that improving consumer penetration around the bigger repositioning around the bigger audience. So we like Rob.

Good morning, Ryan. With the increased move to confections and snacking, or what you're calling the snackier side of your portfolio, is that expansion due to those who are already consuming Atkins and Quest products, or is that largely from those outside the brand family?

Great question. You know, first I would rebrand it from snackier to everywhere, every time products, right?

It says that as people start becoming more mobile, it'll have no impact at all on consumption of these products. So that's good news for us. And as is the case in most things, as it pertains to brand and product, it's a little of both, right?

Well-defined consumer brands, well-defined consumer targets, under-penetrated opportunities to grow. So Quest is a great example of the type of business that we seek. Here's a brand that has shown strong, consistent growth over time. It was well-defined from a brand standpoint. It had a well-understood consumer target. And the opportunity for Quest was it was relatively unknown, relatively low aided and unaided consumer awareness. So the ability to use our marketing expertise to build brand awareness, to drive consideration and prove trial and then conversion, those are the types as opposed to I want to be in this segment or I want this type of product. It's more about, I think, from our standpoint, consumer and brand than it is anything else. And they're hard to find, and when you find them, you've got to grab them. So that's what's on our hunting list. And Quest was possibly the best brand in the category from that, and we're showing that right now in its growth rates, its trajectory, its ability to expand beyond protein bars. its ability to expand beyond specialty channels to food, drug, and mass to other snacking products.

Thanks for slotting me in, and congrats on a strong quarter. Thanks, Jason. You're welcome. I want to make sure that I understood your comments on the retail sales expectations properly. I think you said quarter-on-quarter flap as we go into the fourth quarter, which on my quick back-of-the-envelope math suggests that you may be expecting year-on-year growth to slow to something into the mid-to-high teens. Do I have it roughly right? Yes, you do. Okay. That's still pretty darn robust relative to the comps because I think it actually implies that off of the 2019 level, you're actually going to expect a degree of acceleration from what we saw last quarter. But as I look at the model and the implied guidance for 4Q, you're suggesting a bit of a decel on two-year stack. I was hoping you could help me understand that, maybe unpack that. Was there a pull forward into this quarter? Clearly, there was a bit of a delta between retail sales or anything else in the comparison from last year that we should make note of?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so obviously Q3, as we stated, Jason, was held by the pull in from Q2, the winter storms that inflated the Q3 numbers a little bit.

I didn't appreciate the elevated Simply Protein combo in the fourth quarter. That's helpful. Switching gears real quick, Joe, you kind of alluded to this, I think, with the consumer and the reengagement with weight management.

The thing that's frankly surprised us throughout the fiscal year is that despite movement restrictions and people not being out and about, our buyer performance has been outstanding. So we've seen strong buyer growth throughout the fiscal year, even in the midst of the COVID. So as we move through the summer and into the fall, I would tend to agree with Weight Watchers. There's going to be a catalyst as people get out and about more fully that I think will drive renewed interest in weight management. We're kind of gearing up.

I guess my second question was just, you know, as we look ahead to, you know, 2022, acknowledging that there's significant uncertainty, I'm curious sort of how you're thinking about the fall resets. You did mention that there is this anticipation that consumers will get back into the weight management category. So I guess I'm wondering, are retailers thinking about it similarly? Do you expect the category to gain incremental shelf space and you know, maybe how are retailers thinking about, you know, big brands versus, you know, smaller new brands sort of in this new normal?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, let me try to unpack that. There's a lot of questions in there. First, I would say that we like our product pipeline. We have a very talented R&D organization, terrific marketers. The pipeline that we had this spring and in the fall we think is pretty compelling. So, I suspect, you know, we don't like to talk forward too much. I suspect we'll do really well in the resets. In general, COVID has taught retailers that big brands are important, that if you just think about the dynamic that was going on in COVID, you were fighting for shopper traffic. Big brands matter. So we're seeing that in... in strategy with retailers. They are re-engaging with bigger brands. They understand they're important to the aisle and to the foot traffic. And obviously, we've got two of the bigger brands in the category. So, you know, we're in a nice position with retailers right now, just from an important standpoint. I would also add, you know, we really focus on consumers. and we really focus on building penetration of our brands, that's a language that's really interesting to retailers because they then think about that as shopper conversion from the rest of the store. So I think we're in a very good spot as we move through fiscal 22 just from a brand category aisle standpoint. Your question around do I expect weight management to pick up space, those things are more stable than you would think. So the allocation between adult nutrition, active nutrition, and weight management, there is not a lot of variability kind of reset to reset. So you tend to be in a fixed set for most. More times than not, then they're thinking about the entire aisle and moving between, you know, moving between the three subsegments. That's more rare. But I think overall, I think we're in a really good position as we move through the summer and into the fall for the resets. And five, the Atkins was up 0.20% in the quarter, Quest in the 40s.

Do you think there's any risk of sort of elasticity when those prices go into the marketplace?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"But first, I would say we calculate. As we think about pricing and inflation, we calculate elasticity into our model. So I'd be confident that we understand that dynamic pretty well. Pricing, we're executing a mid-to-upper single-digit price increase. It is on both brands. It's different as a percentage because the inflation hits the brands a little bit differently. And so from a From an execution standpoint, we're in the early stages with conversations with customers. Obviously, this is not a conversation that's in isolation, right? There are manufacturers across the board taking pricing as we speak. And with staring at inflation, significant changes in inflation as we move into fiscal 22.

I'll talk less demographic, more psychographic. The change that we made in Atkins, it's been four years now, was moving from fast weight loss on a program consumers, which were, if I remember right, about 8 million of those in the United States, to low-carb lifestyle weight management concerned consumers. There were about 33 million of those. If you just look at the 8 and the 33, they tended to get younger, tended to get a little bit more active because you're moving away from fast weight loss. You're moving directionally towards more lifestyle-oriented, directionally more healthier people, directionally with people that it's less about, I got to lose weight right now, more about, I want to live right, and I'm looking for solutions to do that.

So, Joe, just kind of a follow-up, I guess, in the last comment, you know, just in terms of the demographic makeup of that consumer, right, as you kind of chip away at the original strategy, right, of simply Atkins obviously very large brand working well with retailers mass traffic is coming up Atkins is very well very large in mass but as you think about the shelf resets maybe it's not this fall maybe it's next fall are there opportunities you think such that you might be even able to replace some of the shelf you have with Atkins with some of the products from Quest if Quest potentially seems to maybe be a bit of a a broader-based brand accepted by different types of demographics. Does that make sense?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, the question does make sense. They tend not to be in the same section of the aisle, in some cases not even in the same aisle. So, no, we won't be swapping brands. For us, it's not a decision of what space do we allocate to Atkins versus Quest. It's how do we gain more space in each of the segments and how do we allocate it. As I think about Atkins and growth, I think about how do we develop our product portfolio beyond bars and shakes. What we've learned during COVID is that Those consumption occasions, especially on bars, are highly dependent on the go and at work. And we've also learned from our Quest business that the snackier portions of that portfolio and confections on Atkins are all the time consumption products, not dependent upon that. So you should expect us, and it's the way we're thinking, to develop our other forms to even a bigger portion of our portfolio. It insulates us to some degree on the kind of back-to-work dynamic. And not surprising, confections on Atkins growing double digits. Our confection business in the earliest stages on Quest growing strong. Our chip business just crazy strong.

That makes sense. And then I guess just Coming back to Jason's original question that's on the top line as you're going to Q4, and then while I respect you, probably don't want to give guide for fiscal 22. There's some commentary on pricing and gross margin, so I'm going to take a shot on the sales side. If I look at the data set over the past four months, just even week by week, total dollar sales have been pretty consistent. It's been very strong, very impressive. If just like you said on the Atkins piece, more correlated to work mobility, we're still in the summer. Some people are going back to work more, but not everybody, not yet. There's not as much critical mass, and probably that improves into the fall. While at the same time, as Jason pointed to, like there could be kind of an off-cycle resolution period. So kind of if I'm just thinking about the retail data sets, you know, it seems as if there is still potential upside, obviously, to the guide, because it would seem like the retail data sets wouldn't necessarily be decelerating that much in the U.S., right, if we're ignoring the Europe piece. And then the storm was a couple percent, but not that much. So I'm just trying to kind of gauge, like, off the commentary, just to be clear, you know, Q3 very strong, maybe Q4 decelerates a little bit. But if we're all thinking about the first half of next year already, it would seem as if there could be increased momentum on an absolute dollar basis as we're coming out of Q4. Does that make sense?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, it does. And look, I mean, obviously, there's a couple of variables here. Q4, as we stated, you know, sequentially, the volume of retail should be, you know, pretty much the same. We're obviously lapping. stronger numbers a year ago, particularly on Quest. So the comps are getting a little bit harder. From a shipping perspective, as I mentioned, we do tend to pull inventory out, especially in Q4. So that's going to be impact for sales. But, you know, we'll see how it plays out and how mobility, if it continues to accelerate or not, that's still a little bit of an open question. We're not anticipating that it does. As we get into next year, Obviously, we're still working through the price increase, so that's a big variable. We'll obviously get back to you at the next earnings call with much more detail on next year's plan. But as you said, first half, just big picture, first half should obviously be stronger than the second half because we are copying still a weak first half COVID impact in this fiscal year. So the first half should be relatively strong. You know, gross margins, you know, as we said, our goal is to maintain the gross margins despite the inflation out there. And, you know, look, at the end of the day, we love the momentum of this business. We feel great about it. But we'll get back to you in the next quarter with more specifics on next year. Rob, I'd also say that we don't see big ??I don't think we're going to see big shifts in consumer mobility anymore. Q4 to Q3. I think it feels more, just if you look at the U.S., it feels more the same. The big shift was in Q3, I think, where it changed very, very quickly, almost like a switch flipped. I think it's going to stay more the same. I think when kids go back to school, I think that'll be the, if there's a catalytic event in movement, it's going to be one They put kids on the bus and they go back to school. And just looking at how businesses are thinking about this, it feels more like post-Labor Day, back to office. Some of it's happening now, but I think you're going to see a big shift after Labor Day.

And then my follow-up question is really on your indulgent brands, i.e. things like Peanut Butter Cup. They were very strong, I think, for both Atkins and Quest in the Quarter. Are you seeing different buyers for those products, or are they the same buyers? And are your buy rates actually better in your indulgent products?

I don't know that data by product form, so we tend to think brand first. But what I would tell you is why it's doing so well is it's a different use occasion.

The snackier portions of our portfolio are not that. They're indeed just a snack. They're kind of indulgent. Sometimes use can be after dinner.

I wanted to ask, you talked a little bit about the success you've had acquiring new buyers, specifically, I think, relative to Atkins, but also the fact that the buy rate continues to kind of lag historical levels, given the fact that we haven't fully returned on-the-go, pre-COVID on-the-go use cases. Could you talk a little bit more about the rate of new buyer acquisition and or how far off the buy rate is today versus historical levels to give us a bit of a sense of the progress and opportunity that those two metrics represent?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so I can give you a high level kind of how the algorithm works that you get a sense of it. In any one year, new buyers, so first-year buyers on Atkins, buy somewhere in the area of 30 to 35 servings. Year two and beyond, buy three times that amount. So if you think about it, we have multiple times weekly buyers in retain. So retain in any one year, the volume in your year, is mostly driven by retained buyers. Your new buyers are a pretty good proxy for how you're going to perform in the next year because we retain a certain portion of those people. So as you look at then our buyers, our increase this year in ??let me step back again, I'm sorry. The buy rate becomes very sensitive to total volume, especially when you apply it against retained buyers. So at 100 servings, if my buy rate is off, that's a significant amount of servings against a big number of retained buyers. So this year, our growth is being driven almost exclusively by the number of total buyers that we have, both retained and new. That's been driving our business. And the buy rate has been a buffer against that. So buy rate is down as a percentage basis kind of in the mid-single digits. So it's a significant number, right? And we've been more than offsetting that with the number of buyers. That's frankly the good news for Atkins because that means I've got good buyer flow going into fiscal 22. If I get any improvements in historic buy rate, which we would expect to do it as people go back to work and bars improve, and as I get the portfolio more developed in other forms, I would expect buy rate to move back towards historic levels.

Nice quarter and nice outlook there. If I could ask first in relation to Quest and, you know, just kind of how the demographic profile, if you will, that user is that different from Atkins and kind of, you know, then what you expect as mobility improves for active nutrition and for weight management as we go kind of, if that hopefully happens throughout fiscal 22?",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so the target audience, the interesting thing, Chris, I think you already know this, the interesting thing is kind of the macronutrient, kind of the nutritional philosophy of both brands is pretty similar, right? On Quest, it's majors in protein because of its active consumer benefit, kind of minors in low-carb and low-sugar, or Atkins with a weight management benefit. majors in low carbs and low sugar and kind of minors in protein. But for the most part, the nutritional profiles are very, very similar. The consumer benefits and the consumer targets are very different. So on Quest, it's about being active and fueling your ability to be active. So it tends to be younger, tends to be fitter, tends to be more physically active. So kind of think of the target audience, adults under 35. Atkins tends to be got a little bit of weight to lose tends to be a little bit older both groups demographically financially a little bit better a little bit better educated but tends to have a little bit of weight to lose on Atkins and tends to be older kind of over 35 so no very very little overlap between the brands and as you look through the year do you yeah go ahead sorry what was your second question as a as a as a If we think mobility improves, how will it affect our brands? Interestingly enough, we've seen Quest accelerate during the second half of the year. Even the Quest bar business has done extremely well. Now, part of that is channel development. C-Store foot traffic is better. Amazon is the largest customer request. So the business has been channel benefited. But we're seeing even the bar business start to accelerate. Atkins, we're really encouraged by the growth. So second half growth was around 12% on an absolute level. Kind of the third and fourth quarter consumption was about the same. The rate has a lot to do with what happened last year. But the composition of Atkins is encouraging. Buyer growth for the year up double digit. And what's been holding Atkins back has been the buy rate, which is kind of down mid-single digits, right? So in doing our analysis on Atkins, we understand being at work is an important driver to snacking occasions and has been holding down buy rates. So We didn't build this into our assumptions on our business, but if mobility improved, we would expect to see upside on our business and in particular on Atkins and in particular on Bars.",positive,0.589,neutral,0.651,positive,0.634,positive,0.965,positive,0.938,positive,0.961,5,0.589,0.0,0.634,0.965,0.938,0.961,1.771,0.0,0.634,2.107,4.072,4.232,0,0,0,1,1,1

Two questions. First, short term, do you think there's any need for more pricing? It's great that the pricing you took in June has gone through, but do you think that there's been sufficient either commodity or freight inflation that you need to take more? And then second question, longer term, I know you talked about favorable operating leverage as enabling adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than gross profit. But you've been able to reduce SG&A now for, I think, three years in a row as a percentage of sales. And I'm wondering how much further you have to go. You're doing a great job advertising more. So how much more fat is there in G&A before you start to cut into muscle from a productivity perspective? Thanks. Thanks.",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so I'll take the first one. So from a pricing gross margin perspective, first I'll just start off and say we're super proud of our ability to expand gross margins by 60 basis points in Q4 and 10 basis points for the full year, just given this supply chain environment that's out there right now. Second, we saw the inflation coming. We priced very aggressively to manage that inflation. and feel really good about the execution of that by our sales force. Commodities are not slowing down. To be frank, we thought when we took the price increase, we might see some leveling off, especially in our second half of the year. We're not seeing that yet. We're still hopeful we're going to see that. But some commodities are slowing down. Some are still growing at accelerated rates. So right now, we feel good about the guidance we've given We don't feel like we need to do any additional pricing. If we do see some modest increase in our cost assumptions, I think we can manage that through trade expense. I'm pulling back there a little bit. But if we see an acceleration beyond what our expectations are, all levers are in play. We will price if we have to. Regarding the SG&A leverage, I would say there's two reasons why we're getting so much leverage right now. One is the Quest integration and the synergies that we got from that. Obviously, we reduced some headcount with the combined companies. We've got some great synergies that we've executed almost fully at this point. So that has helped. Second is just the growth in the business. When you're growing, you know, 10%, 15%, 20% top line, and G&A is only growing maybe 4% or 5%, you get some significant leverage. So I don't see us... pulling back on absolute dollars in G&A, but I think we'll continue to get leverage in our P&L as the business accelerates.",positive,0.61,neutral,0.639,positive,0.664,positive,0.965,positive,0.926,positive,0.975,7,0.61,0.0,0.664,0.965,0.926,0.975,2.949,0.0,2.039,3.072,5.876,6.024,0,0,0,1,0,0

That sounds great.,Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Wendy, this is Joe. I just want to add a little bit of color to what Todd said, and he's being modest. His team has done a phenomenal job of seeing cost inflation soon enough and estimated it well enough that it put us in a position to take what was a pretty aggressive price increase in September. We don't see the need to price again. So in a mid to upper single-digit pricing, we feel like we're in very good shape through the fiscal year. We would have to see a significant acceleration of commodity cost inflation relative to where it is right now in the second half of the year. even think about pulling that lever. And we frankly think that's a relatively low probability. So really congratulations to Todd's team.

So you mentioned earlier in the conversation with Chris some of the successes, particularly around Quest, that you've had winning occasions that may be less tied to mobility than maybe would have been the assumption in the past. I'm assuming... particularly around things like chips and cookies.

So we've had a focus on it. And the reason for it is it's incremental use occasions in need states to bars and shakes. We knew that from Atkins because we had a really big and very strong confection business from the earliest days, and now we have a cookie business and a chip business and a growing confection business on Quest. So we kind of understood that, that those would be incremental consumption occasions. Along comes COVID, and then we learned that Wow, a lot of bar consumption, in particular on Atkins, is consumed at work and in transit. So we were a little fortunate in that our diversification by form and additional need states and use occasions became a nice offset to our bar business. By the way, we're not de-emphasizing our bar business.

So I have eight years of experience with Atkins. The single biggest correlation to growth has been our ability to grow buyers. So we always are focused on how to do that. In the case of Atkins, it's a high brand awareness brand. Virtually everybody knows the brand. The marketing challenge with Atkins was to change their point of view of what they knew. And the marketing efforts are all built around that. The repositioning of the brand away from a programmatic weight loss strategy. brand into a low-carb lifestyle weight management expert. I think we've done a pretty good job of doing that. We feel really good about the growth prospects. In the case of Quest, big brand, growing fast, still relatively modest brand awareness. So over the last few years, people have met the brand by showing up at the shelf and finding really great products that they've tried. Our opportunity on Quest is to drive brand awareness, shape people's point of view about what the brand is about, which our new campaign does.

I guess maybe you could just give us a little bit of a sense of the pacing of that through fiscal 22 and then where you kind of expect your theoretical capacity to sit starting in fiscal 23 relative to where we've been at the fiscal 21 run rate.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'll kick it off and then I'll turn it over to Todd who's been closer to it. The first thing I would say is our challenges on chips and peanut butter cups are because the consumer response far exceeded our expectations on both. So, you know, we did not go into the marketplace believing we were going to have a supply challenge. So this is not about a supplier falling short on what they provided us, said they were going to provide us. This is about us not seeing the consumer response that would have been two really great products. And so on CHIPS last year, as we moved through the year, every time we got more supply, we absorbed it with demand. And so we were not able to build inventory. We weren't able to keep up with service. So knowing that changes in capacity take some time, we slowed demand down to build inventory so we could service the business at what is an appropriate level. And I'll turn it over to Todd. He can talk to you about the moves that we're making to add capacity on chips as we speak. Yeah. So, again, both on chips and cups, we were, as we talked about earlier, we were short or very tight on supplies. We got into Q4. That is largely behind us at this point. We've added capacity on both products in the last month or so. So we're actually in pretty good shape right now. for FOI 22. We actually have more capacity coming on at the end of this year and the beginning of FOI 23 on chips and cups and some other products. So I think we're in pretty good shape for this year. And then as we get into FOI 23, we'll actually have expanded capacity to grow the business. Okay. Thanks to you both.

I wanted to ask a little bit about household penetration or come back to that because, as you said, Joe, it's I think the highest correlation with the growth, particularly for the Atkins brand. Where do you sit today on household penetration for the two brands, And household penetration growth has been strong, to your point, up double digits this year. Are you seeing strong growth on both of the brands? And who are these new consumers that you're attracting? Is it the snackier consumer based on the kind of innovation and occasions that you're capturing? So any commentary around that, kind of the current state of household penetration, the growth and the complexion of that growth in household penetration. Thanks.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"All right. You're talking, you're talking about the thing I, I don't sleep about all the time, right? Which is where are they going to come from and who are we getting? So we're growing penetration on both brands. Atkins is, uh, you know, we identified, uh, our, our positioning shift, which happened around the time we went public, uh, was a move from focusing on what we called low-carb program dieters to, and at the time when we did the study, we thought there were somewhere around 8 million of those. And we had done a nice job in the previous eight years targeting those and having successful growth. The research that we did said there were about 33 million more low-carb consumers, lifestyle consumers who had kind of weight management as one of their consumer benefits. So it's not about weight loss. It's about living with my weight every day and how do I keep that under control. And we've been targeting that consumer. It led to a shift in consumer communication around fast weight loss, lose 12 pounds in eight weeks, you know, pre and post pictures of people that, you know, are celebrities pre and post to Rob Lowe, skinny dudes, never had to lose weight because he knows how to eat and he lives at Atkins Lifestyle. So we've been going after those, that consumer target. And I haven't seen a study in the last year, but when we, last time we looked at it, those self-directed low-carbers with a source of growth. Not a surprise. In the case of Quest, we're gathering our database on Quest from a consumer standpoint. Here's what I do know. The single biggest contributor to Quest's household penetration growth has been the growth of chips. The other forms have been more stable from a household penetration standpoint, but we brought in a significant number of new buyers on chips, and they were incremental to the brand, which then leads you to a series of marketing questions like, do they buy bars? How do we get them to buy more products? And I've already asked all those questions, and the marketing team is working on those things. The other thing I want to know about Quest that we're still trying to learn is when I bring them in, do they stay? How much do they buy? How long do they stay? Some of the things that are fundamental to",positive,0.646,neutral,0.634,positive,0.603,positive,0.947,positive,0.92,positive,0.972,13,0.646,0.0,0.603,0.947,0.92,0.972,6.575,0.0,4.552,7.1,11.393,11.812,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I'm particularly thinking about Quest, which, as you mentioned earlier, is about active nutrition, active lifestyles, fit individuals. And you're moving the brand from kind of a bar orientation into more indulgent occasions with Frosted Cookies this year, for instance. Do you worry that you maybe lose a part of that core active fit positioning? Or is it just, am I not thinking about it the right way, that it's just open-ended and you don't risk losing that kind of, or turning off that kind of core consumer that has brought you to where you are with it? Thanks.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, you know, great question. And it was core to the change in strategy and communication. So if the campaign that was being run prior to the one that just went on air was around the snacks that you crave with the macros that you love, So no compromise. I can get a snack. Those things that I would see on a Super Bowl table for a snack table, those are the things I really crave, and I want to have those every day, but I don't want bad macros. I don't want them to be high in carbs and sugar and low in protein. So that was the positioning before around craveability of snack. The positioning now, which is an evolution of where we were, is around athlete-worthy nutrition, even though you don't need to be an athlete. And it's around fueling people's desire for whatever they're trying to achieve. So it's to some degree about self-actualization without compromise. So great-tasting products. that fuel my desire to achieve what I want to achieve. So we moved away from craveability. Now, the products themselves, there's elements of this that are highly indulgent. Like you mentioned, there are ice cookies. But frankly, it's still around. Regardless of the snack form, it is completely about athlete-worthy nutrition, even though you don't need an athlete. And so we were very choiceful in the campaign. We picked aspiring professional athletes. So we picked two, an NFL rookie and a WNBA rookie, because they're still on a quest to be successful in their professional careers, and our target audience finds them very aspirational. And then we picked two people kind of who changed their career midstream, a former ??a professional football player who became a firefighter, a former office person who became a yoga instructor, right? So, again, it's about fueling their aspirations and their quest in life.

I guess my question is probably more for Todd here, but I'm just trying to get a little bit clearer cadence on how your growth profit margins are going to work. So you priced in June, you announced in June, and you priced September 12th. So Q1 is going to get all but maybe a few days if you're pricing. Is what's holding up the margins, as you're still seeing in the first half, favorable channel and customer and product mix, and that you might be taking a more conservative stance on a comparison basis in the second half. So should we be conservative on our gross margins in 2H?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So for the first quarter, we actually still, as we said in our remarks, Q1, actually, gross margins should be relatively flat. We still have some coverage. at very attractive prices through Q1. And despite what you correctly said, we're not going to see much of a pricing benefit in the quarter. We still had some very favorable coverage. And we do have the channel and product mix that you mentioned, which will allow us, we believe, to keep gross margins relatively flat in Q1. That coverage largely goes away. as we enter Q2. So we do have coverage throughout the first half of the year, but once we get into Q2 and beyond, the pricing is not as attractive as we've had in the second half of this year and this first quarter.

And next question is for Joe. So, Joe, you know, I think you've covered a whole bunch of these points already, but when you look back at your sort of your initial guidance on Quest, you know, I think you said, well, we're going to go at Quest quite slowly because we don't want to screw it up. I think that was your comment. And you've precisely done that. But as you look at Quest now, obviously healthful penetration is a big, is a big positive. Are you more optimistic on Quest today? And just kind of give us our thoughts because the growth there has been phenomenal. And I guess the question is, how sustainable is that growth? And I'm just curious on your perception of Quest now post-acquisition.",Joe Scalzo,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, we had high aspirations and a strong belief in the brand, and the performance of the brand has exceeded both of those. So the business is performing singularly outstanding, and it's been kind of the recent innovation that has been a key driver of the brand. So the R&D pipeline that we acquired with the brand has, for the most part, outperformed our expectations. Very high on chips, strong performance on cookies, strong performance on its entry into confections. RTDs, eh, kind of a push, right? But the other forms performed really, really well. And then we believed that there was opportunity to continue to sharpen the positioning of the brand because people's expectations if you just talk qualitatively to people in focus groups who have purchased the brand, they really don't know for the most part what the brand stands for. Core user that bought the protein bar probably saw it in the gym or bought it online but was part of that little echo system. That core user knows the brand, understands it, knows its history, believes in it. A lot of the recent growth in consumers less clear about what the brand stood for. So our opportunity on the brand, and I think we're just in the early stages of that, is, you said it, we don't want to screw it up, so we were slow about the positioning of the brand, but we feel like we've got a strategy, we've got communication execution that will grow brand awareness and",positive,0.634,neutral,0.617,positive,0.741,positive,0.869,positive,0.934,positive,0.971,16,0.634,0.0,0.741,0.869,0.934,0.971,8.362,0.0,5.799,9.705,14.162,14.706,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chip Sprout performed all year as we grew distribution on it, and it grew household penetration. So in the case of Quest, I can directly tie filling white space with a snack item that significantly grew household penetration. So I think in that case, white space was really important to the brand. The only reason we tend to be conservative about... Talking forward on distribution is I've been in businesses where you build distribution and your velocity per item falls and it's less incremental than you think. So we just like to see it in the marketplace performing before we talk about its incremental value, either from a volume standpoint or penetration standpoint. I like our pipeline. Our pipeline, I believe, will be incremental to our core consumption. So innovating beyond bars and shakes, I think, will be a key strategy to our business going forward. We just like to wait and see how it performs before we talk to you about how we feel about it. I expect with our pipeline, we'll have nice growth in the breadth and the depth of penetration in the marketplace on both of our brands. we'll see how they perform from an incrementality standpoint and ability to drive new buyers to our brand.

And I'll reiterate what everybody else has said about well done on those pricing maneuvers. I think you guys are more the exception than the rule. If I may ask you a little more detail on the mix effect on margins and maybe the mix effect that you expect on margins, given there's an increase in mobility. Obviously, there's a mix effect as it relates to product mixes. Is there maybe a general idea you could give us on how just the impact of or what the impact of mix will have on your margins?",Todd Comfort,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. I mean, there's really two big drivers. So as we've left COVID, you know, bars got hit very hard last year during the initial year of COVID. So as that has come back, bars on both brands is the highest margin products we have. So that's a huge plus. The second piece I would say is from a channel mix perspective, brick and mortar obviously got impacted greatly during COVID, particularly on our business and the e-comm world went crazy. E-comm margins we have are very good, but they are a little bit below our brick and mortar. So brick and mortar and e-comm now have gotten more in balance from a growth perspective. That has helped as well. I can't give you an exact number, but it's been positive. We're not talking a huge amount of delta here because our margins by customer and by form are not dramatically different.
