Good morning, everybody. First question on business insurance.

So how we can think about maybe the RPC for business insurance.",Alan Schnitzer,Chairman and CEO,"Yeah, good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. You know, we stopped getting outlook on price change, but I'll make a couple of comments that hopefully are responsive. We're now several years into compounding year-over-year improvement in rate and price. The three sequential quarters prior to this one, I think, in business insurance anyway, all made record prices. So that's pretty good progress. As a consequence, margins are improving. But having said that, the drivers of price change overall are environmental and still relevant. So We expect that overall pricing and pure rate, for that matter, will continue to be at levels that result in expanding margins for a while now. Whether prices in particular lines go up, down, or sideways, I don't think we're going to try to predict that, but it's all pretty rational. It's all pretty relative to the rate where we need it. Again, there's always a lot of focus on that headline number because that's what we provide, but we're looking hard at the granular execution underneath that takes into account all the variables of account rate adequacy.

But when I look at the amount of renewal rate change that you guys have gotten over the last five to six quarters, I would have thought that there would have been a bit more than two points of improvement this quarter.

So I think the numbers that we see coming through business insurance for rate versus trend align with what we've seen from written results over the last several quarters if you just factor in what's earning its way through. So we did see a steadily increasing level of rate increase over last year and we are seeing a steadily increasing level of improvement in terms of the earned impact of rate versus trend. It moves slowly and it moves in sort of tenths of a point changes at a time. I guess the other thing I'd say to keep in mind is You know, it's not just the simple math of if we've got eight points of rate versus five points of trend, that's three points of margin expansion. It's not. It's rate versus trend. That's a three percentage point difference. But if you translate it into loss ratio points, when you consider, say, theoretically a 60th loss ratio, that translates into a little less than two points of margin expansion.

And we're just trying to get away from giving outlook and prognosticating. But we feel great about what we achieved in terms of pricing this quarter, and we feel very good about the outlook for pricing. In terms of workers' comp, We've said in recent quarters that it feels like we're pretty close to making a bottom and turning around, and we continue to feel that way. We saw progress in the quarter, both in terms of pure rate, which was slightly negative, but a steady improvement over the last several quarters. Premium change, as I said, including exposure, was positive for the first time in a few quarters, which we think really speaks to our customers' confidence. So that was a really good thing. So that's what we'd share about that. I guess the other point I would say, Elise, is it turns out that the workers' comp experience through COVID, at least so far, and we're being cautious about this, but... But at least so far, what we see in the data is that it's a little bit better than we expected. And that could impact pricing going forward. I think the likely result of that is maybe instead of hitting the bottom and inflecting positively, it hits the bottom and bounces around there a little bit before making the turn positive.

And I think that continues. And I think we'll probably take a while to work through what could be the backlog there. So what we've done in terms of both our view of current accident year and prior accident year reserve adequacy is to assume that nothing really has changed. So the data might tell you that things look a little bit favorable. We're not really going to react to that. Our assumption is that once things do get back to normal, ultimately what we're going to see is social inflation at the levels and the trends that we've seen it before. lost cost trend at the elevated rate that we talked about, you know, even in the second quarter of last year, and that ultimately these things will all settle out in reflection of those levels.

But what's driving, if frequency started to come back to pre-pandemic levels and you expect that to continue, I guess, why not take rate now? Why wait? to later in the year, and what's driving that need for rate? If it's not frequency, maybe it is, is it more of the severity?

Thanks for the question. Really, the timing is really just a function of the process.

And to your question about frequency and severity, again, I think in my comments about the quarter in particular, we're seeing frequency coming out of the quarter returning more towards pre-pandemic levels. And we are seeing severity pressure. I spiked out some of the physical damage pressures. And I can give you just a quick example there. You've all seen the news about used car prices being up 50%. That particularly impacts us in the case of total losses, where the average cash value of that total loss is up pretty significantly. There's a little bit of an offsetting good guy there because we get more for the salvage recovery on that total vehicle. But net-net, that's putting upward pressure on severity, and that's one example. Total cost to repair vehicles is up. You know, bodily injury severity has also, you know, got upward pressure on it.

And I guess my follow-up is more on the home side. So the home attrition loss ratio is above 60. That's clearly somewhat elevated, but we've seen the price of something like lumber, timbers come down quite a bit since, you know, mid-2Q. How much of an alleviating factor should we think about that moving forward? in terms of the type of pressure that's putting on the loss ratio at home, or was putting on the loss ratio at home?",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Sure, it's a great question, Ryan. I would say a couple of things. First, in my remarks, I did talk about frequency and severity in particularly frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses driving some of that underlying deterioration. So clearly the lumber prices are a severity item, not a frequency item. And we are seeing, we did see upticks in the quarter in both. I would take just a quick step back as we're talking about auto and property though and just make a couple of observations and then come back and finish the answer to your question. If you take a step back and you look at the segment combined ratio on both an overall and an underlying basis, it's very consistent with the long-run average for this business. And when you look at the auto combined ratio, not surprisingly, in the quarter, it still ran below the long-term average. And in property, in the quarter, the combined ratio is, call it, four to six points above those long-term averages on a total and an underlying basis. So that just sort of gives you a little bit of an order of the magnitude of what we're talking about here. I'd also remind you that in property, the highest combined ratio we see in the year is the second quarter. So you've got to sort of put the second quarter into context. But that said, the severity pressure we saw in the quarter was a combination of labor and materials. So certainly the 50-plus percent increases in lumber are in there. Double-digit increase in roofing materials is in there. high single-digit to low double-digit increases in labor is in there. And when we look at our property loss cost mix, it's really labor followed by contents followed by materials. So even if the short answer to your question, I think, is even if lumber prices come back down, that's still a relatively small component of the loss cost. But we do see period-to-period volatility in frequency and severity. in attritional loss in property. So, again, that's part of why I give you that long-run view of where the quarter was relative to history. And at the end of the day, you know, we take a step back and we look at the renewal premium change we're driving in property, and our focus really is to continue to drive rate in property to address some of those pressures.",positive,0.552,neutral,0.605,neutral,0.629,positive,0.97,positive,0.897,positive,0.97,4,0.552,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.897,0.97,2.165,0.0,0.0,3.74,3.534,3.8129999999999997,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good morning. Just wanted to just follow up a bit more on the auto side. So maybe, Michael, I'm just wondering, I guess, obviously you're taking rate, but how you're thinking about balancing taking rate versus what could be maybe short-lived severity increases, or is the view that these increases in severity that you're witnessing are not transitory and might be more sustainable?",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Yeah, it's a great question, and certainly, you know, as we've talked about severity trends over time, we've pretty consistently talked about the fact that we take a long-run view of trends when we set our prices. Now, you know, if if the starting point is elevated because we've seen an uptick in severity, and that's in our lost costs, you know, the question is, is your starting point elevated, and are you trending off that elevated starting point? Or is your, you know, experience you're seeing, or is the experience we're seeing in this quarter an anomaly? I think if I broke apart frequency and severity for you, I'd say, again, we continue to see the frequency trending towards pre-pandemic levels as continuing. How much of the auto materials cost, physical damage cost, inflation is transitory or not is a key question. And, you know, there's lots of varying opinions around that, and we'll factor our best estimate into, you know, that assessment as we factor in what we think we need for rate on a go-forward basis. Yeah, let me just add to that. Whether... inflation, you know, our view on whether inflation is transitory, we're generally looking out over the duration of the liability. So when we're talking about CPI-type inflation, again, lumber, used cars, et cetera, that's impacting, you know, relatively short tail lines. So we don't really have to forecast long-term in that case.

Good morning. Alan, I guess my first question is on the Fidelis investment as well. You know, through the years, you've said you guys weren't interested in reinsurance deals. Obviously, there's unique features of this investment away from just reinsurance, but I just want to get a sense of just as we think about M&A, like has your stance on reinsurance changed? And then you guys issued $750 million of debt in the quarter, and it was earmarked for business growth. So I'm just trying to ??is you tying that capital into potential M&A, or is that more earmarked for organic business growth?",Dan Fry,Chief Financial Officer,"Let me start with Hidalgo, and then I'll ask Dan to comment on the capital raise. Okay. There's just nothing at all about this that signals any shift in our thinking about reinsurance. We are primarily focused on being a primary rider with very limited interest in reinsurance, and that remains the case. It just so happens that Fidelis writes some of their business in the form of reinsurance, but that's just one of their four pillars of business. There are some interesting aspects of their reinsurance business. They've got really thoughtful risk management tools. They're really thoughtful with risk and reward, and so... there's the potential for us to learn something in terms of managing our own cap portfolio. And I will point out why it hasn't been, and I don't expect it to be any significant focus for us. We do write a little bit of reinsurance where it's complementary to our core business. So, for example, we've got a boiler rebusiness. So it's not completely foreign to us. It's a very, very, very small part of what we do. No change in strategic focus. But it's not alarming to us, and in this respect, we think that there's something for us to learn. And Elise, regarding the capital question, no change at all in our philosophy or urgency around M&A or lack of urgency around M&A. It's really coincidental, the timing of when these things came together, and again, the much in the way of capital management anyways.

Having said that, it's applicable to the accounts that renewed. That's the measure that it would apply to. I don't know, Greg, you want to? Yeah, I mean, just a little bit more color on select. We've shared with you that we've been very focused on improving the profitability of that business. And so we've certainly been very thoughtful around production and pursuing margin improvement for rates in terms of conditions and that sort. I will tell you also in the select business, during the pandemic, because of some of our ability to have a little more flexibility for our customer, we suspended some billing and some cancellation activity, and now that's back in play in the marketplace.

You know, it really is a continuation of the conversation that we've been having with you in terms of the way we've been managing it. I think we've talked a lot about California in particular in the context of wildfires, but certainly the peril is a peril that exposes us across more states in the West than just California. So one specific development I would point you to in 2021 is we've extended our agreement with wildfire defense systems to apply to Colorado in addition to California. So we've got that sort of risk prevention partnership extending across an additional state in the West, which we think on the margin is helpful. And then maybe just an update on our progress in California, you know, in addition to the launch of the new product, which we successfully got in market in 2020, we're now converting California policies to that new product. So think new pricing segmentation, think new rate level, think new eligibility as respect to wildfire exposure. And just last month, we got an additional 6.9% rate increase approved on the property product in the state. So we continue to manage through rate eligibility, terms and conditions, And we do continue to work our way through the non-renewal activity subject to the lifting of the moratoriums as they expire as another lever we're pulling.

First question, Alan, I think might be to your opening comments on BI. And you listed a number of reasons why pricing environments should remain strong. I guess maybe help us define or think about what you mean by strong and how we can think about maybe margins for BI into next year or I guess the back half of next year. We have pricing now kind of close to where loss trends are. So just kind of help think about when you list those reasons why pricing should remain strong. you know, should we expect this pricing to, it seems like start to converge with where loss trends are, which obviously could have some impact and margins into 2022. So just comment on what you meant by strong there.",Alan Schnitzer,Chairman and CEO,"Yeah, good morning and thanks for the question. You're very narrowly, I think, focusing on rate versus loss trend. And by the way, there's still a margin there. And even if you look at pure rate over, you know, some long historical period, the rate we continue to get is actually a pretty good number. But if you look at the overall pricing number, I mean, at 9.9, that's, you know, practically an all-time high, and there's a lot of margin in that exposure. So we continue to see a nice spread between, you know, written price and lost trend, and I do think that's the right way to think about it. Nonetheless, as we, you know, we know what our product returns are, we know what the headwinds are, we know what our objectives are in terms of our returns, and we know what we need to do. So I think that from here, pricing will continue to be strong. Now, we've also been getting pretty good pricing for some time now, and it's been compounding for a while. And so you've got different lines in different places. Some need more help than others. And so from here, the rate of increase is going to be impacted by that. So some lines are The rate of increase will be, you know, higher. Some will go sideways. Some ??there will still be an increase, but the rate of increase may go down.

Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. Second question for you or Mike maybe on personal auto. Mike, I appreciate your comments on it was more of a frequency-backed pre-pandemic. To a lesser degree, the environmental issue is with loss severity. So I guess, do you think the loss severity side there on auto, has it peaked? Will it get worse from here, do you think? And how long-lasting will that be? I ask that because I wonder if it's to a lesser degree that. The 97% core, you know, it's not that much higher than where you were pre-pandemic, 96, 95, and that kind of range. So I ask those questions because I wonder how much rate you think you need in personal auto if those things have already peaked. I'm not sure if they have or how long they might last. And your comment was they're to a lesser degree anyway. So any comments there would be appreciated.",Alan Schnitzer,Chairman and CEO,"Yeah, sure, Michael. It's Michael here. I would say a couple of things about that. So To dimensionalize that a little bit more for you, the auto underlying combined was up 15 points in the quarter. We'd say three quarters of that was loss experience returning to pre-pandemic levels. And about a quarter, about a remaining quarter of that is the trends in increased cost to repair and replace that we talked about last quarter that essentially continued into the quarter. In terms of how long it's going to last, I can point you to a little bit of external data that might help there. There's certainly pressure on the system. A lot of the costs relate to total losses and replacement cost values for total vehicles, which tracks pretty closely with used car prices. And inside the quarter, we were actually encouraged by the July and August data from places like the Moody's Used Car Price Index that looked like the peak had happened in May and June and was starting to decline in the first part of the quarter. Now, that data ticked back up again in September. And I think it's ticked back up reflects the pressure on the system. You know, you had Ida occur in the quarter. Estimates are that over 200,000 vehicles were destroyed there. in that event at the same time that you have vehicle inventories in the U.S. at historic lows. And so, you know, I think we're going to see continued pressure on the cost to repair and replace related to supply chain, related to labor, and related to used car parts and prices. But, again, that was about a quarter of the 15 points. and we will factor that into our underwriting pricing decisions as we move forward.

If I take a step back and think about the process a little bit more broadly, what we would say about the process of getting rate is that it is an ongoing dialogue between us and the regulators. It's about an exchange of information to justify the pricing that you think you need on a go-forward basis. And generally speaking, what we have found is we've been able to get to a point where we can align price with loss costs over time. You'll have some challenging conversations in some jurisdictions and maybe less challenging conversations in others. To put a little bit of a point on the 40 jurisdictions, we do expect some of those increases to become effective in Q4. And actually, a couple of them literally this month. So we're on the way to getting those increases filed and approved. And then as we've talked about, it'll take time for them to get written and then earned into the book of business.

And then my second question just goes back, I guess, to the prior question as well. You guys have been within BI at around that 5% overall loss trend for, I think, like six quarters now.

And at least I'd add to that, there was nothing unusual about this quarter relative to any other quarter.

I think the other dynamic you see in a preferred book, though, is newer vehicles with more technology. And so when you think about some of the cost pressures on repair and replacement costs, that's going to put upward pressure there. And I would say that while we saw I think some differences over the past 12 to 18 months that you could sort of point to in different parts of the country, different books of business, in terms of how the pandemic impacted different segments differently. As we sit here today, the economy is broadly recovering. The country is broadly recovering. So you don't see quite as many differences, I don't think, geographically or by segment that are driving differences in loss experience across segments of the industry.

It's Michael. I think, first of all, we would not have expected any rate increases to take effect this quarter. As we talked about it last quarter, we were beginning to process the seeking rate, which means we've got to put together the filing package. We've got to file that with the state. We've got to negotiate with the state. We've got to get it approved. We've got an agree upon an effective date, which is always in the future from the date you get the approval. So there's a fairly long tail on the front end of any rate filing process up or down. And so we really wouldn't have expected any of those increases to take effect in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we've got 40 planned over the course of the next three quarters. And a couple, two or three, will likely take effect this month. Several, call it another handful, will take effect probably before year end. Again, all subject to getting approvals from the states that we are working towards those effective dates with.

What do you think of those efforts, and is that something that Travelers has a particular view on?",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Sure, Paul. It's Michael. Certainly, there are conversations that link the two. I guess I'd start by separating the two, right? There are certainly conversations with state regulators and a handful, I would say, that are talking about and are actively pursuing the removal of credit scoring as a variable in pricing auto insurance. The two most notable are Washington and Colorado. Colorado has a bill that was approved by the state legislature that's in the rulemaking process around removing credit score in that state. In the state of Washington, again, pretty widely followed, but Commissioner Kreidler issued an emergency rule to ban the use of credit scoring in auto insurance. That emergency rule was actually just overturned by a judge in Washington earlier this month. And so, you know, we're in the process, and the overturn by the judge is now being challenged by the commissioner. So there's a back and forth in Washington. Those are probably the two most widely viewed views on credit scoring. As respects credit scoring in telematics, what we would say is, first of all, credit is a powerful variable in pricing auto insurance. It's very predictive of claim experience, and if you remove it, then you're You have subsidization in your rate plan between higher risk drivers and lower risk drivers. And in fact, in the context of a telematics program, the credit score and the telematics data are powerful together.

My first question goes to Otto and the speed to which I guess you think you can get improvements there given you're more of a package writer. So we've seen Retention is held steady, PIF relatively steady. Others are seeing drops there as they kind of curtail growth. Your pricing of 1.2%, clearly not enough, obviously, but I'm sure you'll take more, as you said. But is the fact that you're more of a package writer more of a hindrance to your ability to get the improvements that you think you need over the course of the year versus peers that don't have as much package? Is that more of a hindrance? And will that create more of a slowdown in profitability as the year comes out? Thanks.",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Sure, Michael. It's Michael Klein. So I would say the short answer is no, but let me unpack that a little bit. So first, the fact that we're a package writer, I actually think the benefit of being a portfolio solution provider showed through in our results this quarter with relatively strong performance in home balancing some of the challenges we see in auto, number one. Number two, Because we have a balanced portfolio of about 50% property, 50% auto, our overall segment results are actually less sensitive to the trends in auto than the average competitor who is more, say, 60, 40, 70, 30. Probably most importantly, though, is there's nothing about our being a portfolio solution provider that influences our resolve to improve profitability in auto. As you mentioned, the 1.2%, that's we posted in the quarter is encouraging but clearly not enough, which is why, you know, we're on a path towards accelerating renewal premium change over time.

So, you know, almost two years ago, everybody is the sky's falling, it's gonna be the worst industry ever. Clearly, not the case. But we've had Delta, we've had Omicron, and so there's still some concerns. But I guess, Last I've seen from you guys' comments on that is still the bulk of your reserves there, which I think are north of $250 million, are in IVNR. So at what point do you get comfort in saying that either it comes down because they're not going to get reported, or have you seen anything that's been reported that it's still the bulk in IVNR?

And as we've said, you know, in each of the last few quarters, I think we've taken a cautious approach in that regard. I think there's uncertainty as to what the ultimate severity may be for some of those claims. We know courts are not yet fully reopened, so reporting patterns may be slowed. We're just going to continue to take a cautious approach. Having said that, within our PYD figures, there is favorability from accident year 20.

Can you compare that to what you're actually seeking in terms of price hikes and just the process of sort of getting approvals and how they should flow through? Just trying to get an idea on whether you think margins can begin to improve if inflation does not cool down. And then I had another one.",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Sure, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. It's Michael. So the 1.2, right, is the written renewal premium change across the portfolio. You could sort of think of it as including a weighted average of the rate we've achieved in the states we've gotten it, right? So 11 out of, call it, 46 states we got rate in. The other important thing is the 11, the number of the 11 that I gave you is a new business effective date, not a renewal effective date. There's a little bit of a lag in the impact on renewals underneath that 1.2. What I would say is, in terms of the process, we are largely being successful in achieving the rate we're asking for state by state. Obviously, every state's a little bit different, but as I mentioned, we're pursuing the rate we think we need based on the trends we see. Your point about what happens with severity and loss trend from here is a really good one, right? The filings we got approved in the fourth quarter of last year were based on our, you know, experience and our outlook for trends at that point in time. And as we seek additional rate as we move into 2022, we'll continue to update those assessments and those assumptions and that'll drive the rate we request on a state-by-state basis.

Yeah, we have not changed our general view of loss trend in BI. But remember, you know, loss trend is a long-term view of a loss inflation. And there are other levers for us to, you know, to account for other sort of loss activity going on that we don't necessarily think is part of long-term trends. So we can change the base year. We can book losses relative to what we see in any particular quarter. And so, you know, I think you heard from Michael in particular. I know your question was about BI, but, you know, you heard from Michael in particular that we did book some losses in PI. We did in BI as well for, you know, severity, think labor and material inflation. So we did see a little bit of that, and that's reflected in our numbers. You know, I think you heard from Dan in his prepared remarks that in terms of social inflation, you know, while I would say what we're seeing maybe is, you know, a little bit better than what we saw a few years ago, but we're assuming that's due to distortion in the data and that hasn't abated at all. So, we continue to account for that. And you mentioned climate change. Climate change is a hard one to think about in any given period because you think about weather patterns over a long period of time.

But when we look at overall pricing, you know, BI in excess of nine, think about where loss trend is, where, you know, we're we're comfortable where the trends are heading.

You know, Greg pointed out, and you can see in the data, we've been getting pretty good price increases for a while now, which has changed our overall return profile and view of rate adequacy.

I think it's something that we continue to monitor. I would say that there are a couple of places that we have data that demonstrate changes in driving behavior.

Commuting versus non-commuting, time of day, and whether you look at external data sources, whether we look at our own IntelliDrive data, we do see a shift in those driving patterns. The other item that, again, I think you'll see in here talked about quite a bit is just change in driving behavior. And so in the context of those new driving patterns, we and industry observers have observed increased speeds. When you look at, unfortunately, the continued rise in fatalities on highways, some of the data shows increased evidence of fewer people wearing seatbelts. having an impact on fatality data. And again, our own data and that from others also indicates increases in distracted driving, you know, interacting with the phone while operating the vehicle. So I think we do see changes in, again, time of day, type of driving, and actual driving behavior that will have an impact on losses.

We're happy with it. You know, that said, the full year is still a 98, which is up from last year. Underlying is an 85 up from last year.

We give it from time to time episodically when we think it's relevant for providing an insight into the results we're achieving. But we don't give it routinely. I'm not even sure I know offhand how that number is necessarily trended, although, you know, I would probably just, you know, pull the lens back a little bit and say, you know, over the last few years, pricing has been very strong.

You know, even, you know, you mentioned the renewal premium change, obviously the 9.2, but, you know, I noticed that new business really moved the needle this quarter and that's, you know, a change versus, you know, the prior couple quarters. So I'm just wondering, did something change in terms of your appetite for new business? Any enhancements that you've made this quarter versus the last few? I'm just trying to get a sense for how sustainable you think the 9% growth is as we head into 2022.",Alan Schnitzer,Chairman and CEO,"Hey David, this is Greg. In my prepared comments, I did share with you that we were more successful in some larger accounts in middle market and If you go back, I've shared with you that that's lumpy at times. Last quarter, we didn't hit on as many large accounts in the quarter before we did. And so you get a little bit of lumpiness when you get into accounts greater than 500,000. That was one dynamic. But generally, also, our underlying combined ratio is across our full portfolio, the book of business, and that includes new business. So as we continue to improve the margins on the business, we continue ??to have better outlooks in terms of what our new business is. Our underwriters are incredibly disciplined around risk selection and, you know, they want to be active partners for our agents and brokers that are, as our business continues to improve, we continue to be more active with our hits on our new business. And David, I'll just share, just stepping back from the results in the quarter, you know, key to everything we do and key to, I think the success we had in BI is, is franchise value. It's, It's having products and services our customers, agents, and brokers value. It's having the data and analytics to segment the risk and get the right price on it. It's making sure we've got great experiences for all of our constituencies. It's a lot of hustle.

It's really more the latter. So if you look at, you know, this is now the fourth year we've had this treaty, and it's always ??it's always ??covered a $500 million layer.

We went from 86% the first year down to 56% the second year. This last year was up to 70%. This year is in at 45%. We're not trying to manage the total cost of the treaty.

And then just a quick follow-up on personal auto. Similar to last quarter, you sound pretty confident of all the rate increases you're taking, but I noticed your 6% PIF growth was a pretty high number year over year for travelers. Do you think that's something that could slow down in subsequent quarters, or could that be like a new normal given some of the strategic stuff you're doing like IntelliDrive?",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","Yeah, Tracy, great question. You know, I would say, you know, you've got to look at both the year-over-year and sequential quarter numbers there. You know, 5%, 6%, 1%, 2% sequential quarter growth we do think is driven by the investments we're making in the product, but it's also a function of, you know, our pricing relative to the market.

I'd say those are two different things, right? So one is your filing strategy. The other is your product mix. We do tend to write more 12-month policies than a lot of our auto monoline or auto-focused competitors, but we do write a mix of 12- and 6-month policies. The fact that we write, you know, more 12-month policies, though, doesn't mean that we can't take multiple rate changes in a jurisdiction in a year. And so we may, in some states, take a couple of rate increases in 2022, and those will hit the renewals as they hit them, depending upon the policy terms.

Thanks for still squeezing me in here. So my first question may be a little bit long-winded, but hopefully you bear with me. So in personal auto, looking back to the 2014 through 16 cycle, I think many had pointed to the deterioration of bodily injury severity, particularly for high-limit policies. Whereas this time around, I think the deterioration is really coming from physical damage severity. If you agree with that premise, is it reasonable to think that travelers, given that it is more weighted to higher limit preferred insurance, would need less rate than more standard and non-standard books and therefore would maybe benefit from market share gains here?",Michael Klein,"President, Personal Insurance","I guess I would say that it's reasonable to ??I wouldn't assume it. I think it's reasonable to monitor that. I would say that our pricing strategy is reflective of both our book of business and our loss experience. And so in many respects, you know, we have a different rate need than another competitor because of the profile of our book, the mix of our book. We also do tend to write more full coverage. So even the product we're providing to the customer, right, when you get into, you know, the non-starter standard market, you tend to see a little more liability only. And so that's going to change the pricing dynamics. But again, I would say, you know, we're seeking the rate we think we need based on our loss experience and the trends we see.
