"Got it. Okay. Thanks for that, Dave. Also, do you guys have a sense as to the growth in the participation rate from consumers that you're looking to engage in outdoor recreation?

So, you know, we can't give you that answer. You know, it's our assumption that there are new consumers coming in as well as, you know, more active participation by existing consumers. And I think, you know, we could say that across, you know, all the outdoors areas. spaces that we've seen growth in.

If there's any one category other than the fish finders where you're particularly excited about for new product introductions?","Well, I think, you know, we've got new products for every business. And in fishing, you know, this is a solid year, and we talked about a few of those. So I don't think it's any different than the past. It's just part of, you know, us doing business, and we try to innovate and have something new every year, depending on the category.",790.375,814.011,3,2021,1,0.449,1.132,0,-0.063,-0.199,0,0.426,1.056,0,0.177,0.757,0,0.751,2.311,0,0.948,2.847,0

So can you give us a sense as to where you are with your capacity now and what should we look for in terms of your ability to increase capacity from here?","Yeah, I mean, we're kind of set for the season in a way. We added shifts early to our factories where we're building product. and that's been very helpful. Of course, adding a lot of seasonal labor, which has its challenges, but we've done that as well. So we're working as fast as we can to meet the demand right now, and those are kind of the two short-term levers that we've pulled.

I mean, electric parts coming in, we're working very hard to make sure we have an adequate supply. I think we've done a good job so far of maintaining that, but As you heard, I'm sure out there in the industry, there are shortages here and there and longer lead times.

So, I mean, we've always used air freight a little bit here and there historically, but it's just much more pronounced this year. And it's probably, you know, it probably impacted our margin, you know, modestly compared to the cost of goods sold inputs. It was, you know, kind of compared to that.

In your term, kind of what you're thinking here versus maybe what you were thinking at the beginning of the fiscal year?","Yeah, I'm hoping the health care is a one-off thing just because there's no activity in prior year's quarter. And in terms of the labor inputs, I mean, there's pressure there.

A piece of that is M&A. A piece of that is investing in organic growth, so those are both key for us. We'll continue to do that.

I mean, where we are importing Product tends to have more pressure, but we tend to kind of do that across the board.

"Yes, good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. So, yeah, first I just wanted to follow up. Dave, you mentioned that the current demand outlook is healthy. Are you seeing that across the board in all your categories, or does one – particular category stand out versus others?","You know, I'll take that question. We are definitely seeing, you know, strong demand still across the board. I would say with the diving is the one that is a little less consistent, but we see positive upward movement in that business. But, you know, as far as we can tell in, you know, we have We certainly have our shipment data, but we get a limited amount of point-of-purchase data. But as far as we can tell, the demand is still very healthy across the other three businesses and growing in diving.",2519.998,2558.31,9,2021,4,0.429,2.987,0,-0.067,-0.6089999999999997,0,0.585,2.893,0,0.099,1.998,0,0.862,7.222,0,0.967,8.388,0
"Got it. Okay. And is the diving, is that perhaps because of the new variant for COVID, or is that something else you think?","No. Well, I think we are still the aftermath of COVID in general would shut down travel, and that's a very travel-sensitive business. But we've got programs going for local diving, and we are launching some new products as well, which tend to help us gain some volume and break through some of the negative pressure that's resulting from COVID. So we feel good that we will continue to see some rebound in that business.",2567.157,2601.608,10,2021,4,0.365,3.352,0,-0.0699999999999999,-0.6789999999999996,0,0.644,3.537,0,0.1999999999999999,2.198,0,0.889,8.111,0,0.936,9.324,0
"Okay, that's great to hear. And then which segments should we expect to see the most margin pressure? You know, again, is it kind of across the board or does one category kind of stand out where you think you'll see a hit to margins more so than the others?","You know, I would say it's across the board. I mean, where we are importing product tends to have more pressure, but we tend to kind of do that across the board. So we're importing electronic components, and we're sourcing some finished good product from Asia. Those tend to have the most pressure on them. But that's a long answer, but I think it's pretty much across the board.",2621.379,2644.808,11,2021,4,0.288,3.64,1,-0.071,-0.7499999999999996,0,0.006,3.543,1,0.25,2.448,0,0.7190000000000001,8.83,0,0.888,10.212,0

And have you done any price increases, or do you plan to do price increases to offset some of these headwinds?","Yeah, I mean, we're looking at everything, and, yes, we have taken price increases to help offset. It's a pretty dynamic environment, so we continue to evaluate that, and we won't be afraid to continue to take appropriate actions where necessary.",2654.73,2670.512,12,2021,4,0.244,3.884,0,-0.0639999999999999,-0.8139999999999995,0,0.075,3.618,0,-0.0109999999999999,2.437,0,0.752,9.582,0,0.935,11.147,0
Got it. Okay. And then do you have a sense as to what the inventory levels are at retail?,"You know, I – we – you know, it continues to be a thin inventory level because, you know, the demand is significantly, you know, higher than it has been historically.

"Got it. Okay. That's great to hear. And then, you know, lastly, just a quick housekeeping question here. So you mentioned the tax rate will be in the mid-20s. Should that you know, vary much throughout the year or kind of, you know, more or less you think you'll be consistent? And then second part to that housekeeping question is just what you expect for CapEx for fiscal 22.","Yeah, for the tax rate, I mean, it's hard to say quarter by quarter just because the profitability varies so much seasonally, usually. So that's a difficult one to answer. But, you know, mid-20s is probably a fair bet on that. For CapEx, yeah, we ended this year about 21 and change in CapEx. I would expect that to increase next year as we add capacity. It could be up, you know, 30% to 40% versus this year.",2724.788,2757.34,14,2021,4,0.297,4.402,0,-0.0689999999999999,-0.9579999999999994,0,0.175,3.871,0,0.868,3.327,0,0.829,11.247,0,0.97,13.087,0
