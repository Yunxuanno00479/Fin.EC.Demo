"Hi. A couple of questions. I was wondering if you might be able to expand on the six new logos you added, if there's any color you can provide either on verticals or type of customer or program.","Yes. So, Jim, this is Todd. I'll get us started, and I'll have Steve provide some of the details around the sectors and the opportunities. But The one thing I wanted to highlight about the new program wins that I think is significant, and I hope that people take away from this, is if you look at our business development approach, it's really to grow with existing customers, to find the right customers and then grow with those customers. And I talked about six new logos, and Steve talked about 14 new relationships. So that includes the six logos plus eight new divisions of existing logos. So when you look at this, we – We get a new logo in, we transition it, we potentially add additional divisions, and we grow with each of those, the original division or logo as well as the expanded relationship that we have with the other divisions. So I wanted to point that out, and then I want to turn it over to Steve to get into a bit more detail. Sure, Jim. In terms of color, they were equally split across the sector. So there was two in industrials, two in healthcare, life sciences, and two in aerospace. And some of the Wednesday details that I went into highlighted some of them. The anesthesia program that I talked about in healthcare was one of them. The device that's used for advanced manufacturing process control was one of them, as well as the air purification system. And so that gives you a little bit more insight into it was a pretty good mixed across all three of the sectors. Thanks for that color.",1821.274,1918.446,1,2021,1,0.488,0.488,0,-0.067,-0.067,0,0.3249999999999999,0.3249999999999999,0,0.913,0.913,0,0.8099999999999999,0.8099999999999999,0,0.967,0.967,0
"And by the way, I think you gave some good color on how we should be thinking about the second half of the year. But I wanted to go to that target that you're talking about for revenue of 9% to 12% growth. And clearly, last year was impacted unquestionably by COVID. And this year, you've got some moving parts as well. But I'm trying to get a sense What's given you that confidence about that 9% to 12% revenue growth? It sounds like it's the wins that are coming in. It's a question of when do you potentially see that conversion. It's obviously not going to, I think, happen this year.","Yeah, so I think, Jim, you're right on with your assessment about this year is that the 9 to 12 would be difficult in this year. And kind of the way I've characterized it in the release and in the script here is that if you do the math, it wouldn't add up to the 9 to 12. But there's a number of things that give us confidence that 9 to 12 is a success. a realistic and very achievable goal. And first of all, if we look backward looking over the period of 18 to 20, we were at 10%. So our sectors and our markets have shown that they can support that level of growth. Then if we look, and that includes last year with the pandemic and that number as well, I know as we go through our planning process and we do a bit of a bottoms-up planning, our teams, again, their results support our revenue growth goals. But there's really four factors that I think serve as catalysts for us as we go through fiscal 21 and into fiscal 22. First of all, we have the margin expansion and the sustainable margin expansion, which I think we're doing a nice job of showing that that's very achievable. Second, we've got the recovery of medical equipment used for elective procedures. And we're starting to see a hint of a sign of that right now, but I wouldn't say it's a recovery by any means. So there's great opportunity with that as we move forward. And there's also the increase in demand that we expect to see from commercial aerospace as we see travel upticks post the COVID vaccine rollout. So that may be an early 22 type event is what we're expecting. And then we have the new program ramps. And you saw the win success that we've had, the over billion-dollar trailing four-quarter funnel that we have. We've talked about some of the exciting new programs that have been long-term ramps within our healthcare life sciences sector. These all come to fruition in the F-22 issue. type timeframe here. So we've got a number of catalysts that are looking really good for us as we get beyond or go through fiscal 21 and get into fiscal 22.",1962.644,2100.352,2,2021,1,0.489,0.977,0,-0.059,-0.126,0,0.6519999999999999,0.977,0,0.969,1.882,0,0.901,1.711,0,0.964,1.931,0
"Got it. Just on commercial air, could you just remind us what that's representing right now of the A&D or maybe just historically what it was? And then I'll jump back in the queue.","Yeah, it's about, let me get the number. I think it's in the mid-30s right now, but I'm going to verify that. It's kind of low 30s is about where it's at right now, and it had been probably a little bit over 40 to even 45 percent at one point. Yeah, that's a plexus of the sector. It's about roughly a third.",2115.128,2136.391,3,2021,1,0.146,1.123,0,-0.065,-0.191,0,-0.0039999999999999,0.973,0,0.712,2.594,0,0.698,2.409,0,0.971,2.902,0
"okay thanks good morning and congrats to sean and heather um todd i just wanted to start uh with some questions around the second half comments where revenue is relatively consistent with the fiscal 2q guide just maybe the biggest drivers of why we would see effectively flat sequential trends in q3 and q4 because we normally expect to build up each quarter see it up sequentially on a seasonal basis Sounds like towards the end of the quarter, medical and industrial saw recent strength. You've got new customers coming on. So what would be the offsets that I'm missing to make Q3 and Q4 effectively below normal seasonality?","Yeah, I think the issue, Adam, is that the visibility is just fairly limited right now. So I would say it's more of a situation as we're just not sure or we just don't know. And if you think back to – A quarter ago when we had our call, we expected Q2 to be flat to Q1. I mean, obviously it's not. It's up substantially on the order of about $50 million. So we saw a lot of upside demand come in, particularly around the healthcare and in the industrial sector. So as our customers brought up forecasts, they just brought them up in the near term and not necessarily further out. So I'd say there's a lot of uncertainty to us as to whether we're going to see something similar as we move through the rest of the year or whether we won't. But based off of the visibility we have right now, it looks more like flat at this time. But I think in some sense we're a little bit of a victim of our success from an execution standpoint because our customers feel comfortable that they can drop in demand and we'll execute on it.",2189.472,2253.967,4,2021,1,0.429,1.552,0,-0.067,-0.258,0,0.199,1.172,0,0.885,3.479,0,0.823,3.232,0,0.974,3.876,0
"Right, that's understandable. And just to clarify, does that also mean that operating margin would kind of stick in that 5% to 5.5% range that was guided to Q2?","Yeah, it's a bit uncertain. I mean, I think obviously we're targeting to be above the 5% range, but it's a bit uncertain based on the revenue and the leverage that we get. So it's a little too early to call that one.",2263.867,2277.458,5,2021,1,0.137,1.689,0,-0.07,-0.328,0,-0.072,1.1,0,0.6990000000000001,4.178,0,0.742,3.974,0,0.968,4.843999999999999,0
"Okay. And just maybe a longer-term question. You talked about the record over $3 billion funnel. You talked about committed to the 9% to 12% long-term revenue growth. Just trying to understand, you know, does that imply, you know, potentially a supersized growth year in fiscal 22 such that the average of 21 and 22 can be in the 9% to 12% range? So maybe just help with expectations on timing and magnitude of what seems like a pretty big growth uptick upcoming.","Sure. This is Steve. I'll try to handle that one. Obviously, trying to give guidance up to 22 would be a bit challenging, but looking at the market dynamics of where we're at, which gives us some optimism, is, you know, we look at commercial aerospace and, you know, we're strong in there. We've gained market share. We talked about the fact that we've been bouncing around the bottom and we see this down. And so we see that as a catalyst for growth in terms of what could happen into 22 as things start to recover. We've talked about the elective procedures in healthcare life sciences. We believe we're continuing to take market share. We're winning new logos. And we think there's a catalyst there to help accelerate some growth as things start to recover post-COVID. And then we've talked for the last couple of calls talking about an industrial team in semi-cap and with semiconductor capital equipment. The signals are out there that demand for semiconductor equipment or equipment and devices is only going to increase over time. Looking at our forecast and Todd's comments, we see these flattish kind of forecasts and then we see the short-term drop-ins. I think at some point there's a potential for that to turn into real forecast demand. You know, the optimism of the 9% to 12% is driven by those types of factors combined with the fact that we continue to win decent amounts of new business. And so I think that's why we're optimistic about the growth. Could it outperform? I think if the economy takes off and all these things start to recover post-COVID, you know, I think there's a real chance that demand from our customers continues to increase at a pretty good clip with it.",2306.469,2408.35,6,2021,1,0.486,2.175,0,-0.063,-0.391,0,0.6639999999999999,1.7639999999999998,0,0.965,5.143,0,0.909,4.883,0,0.972,5.816,0
"Great. Thanks for letting me ask the question. And first, congrats to Sean for the transition. First, I wanted to ask maybe about the 2Q demand. And do you think that we're seeing any pull in maybe from some of the second half demands? Or is this mainly just the drop in the early demand or the short-term demand?","Go ahead, Steve. Yeah, I mean, specifically with the Q2 upside, it is upside that's not robbing from future quarters. So our forward-looking quarters have stayed consistent and actually have come up a bit. And so it is upside demand. It's not stealing from future quarters. And as Todd kind of highlighted earlier, You know, one of the things we're looking at is are we going to see this as a trend as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4? It's just something we're watching.",2444.773,2472.755,7,2021,1,0.311,2.486,0,-0.0599999999999999,-0.4509999999999999,0,0.065,1.829,0,0.445,5.588,0,0.7699999999999999,5.653,0,0.58,6.396,0
"Okay, great. And then just kind of thinking about the COVID-related tailwinds, the shorter-term, the non-sticky. How much of your business, I guess, in the healthcare industry is the shorter-term COVID tailwinds that could potentially fade into next year or the year after?","Yeah, so... Right now there's not a lot beyond testing and point of care testing that I would call a true COVID tailwind where the demand is up as a result of COVID. Now we see that demand is progressing or continuing at least through calendar 2021 and even our customers are talking about it going beyond that in through 22. And one thing to point out too, I mean we call them COVID testers a lot, but what they are is they're testers that that can be used for COVID, so they can test many other things as well, too. But that's the only thing I would say is a true COVID increase that's in our forecast right now, other than the small amount of upside that Steve talked about on the one critical care product.",2490.962,2538.132,8,2021,1,0.416,2.902,0,-0.07,-0.5209999999999999,0,0.236,2.065,0,0.902,6.49,0,0.899,6.552,0,0.973,7.369,0
"Great. Thanks for the call. And one last, if I can, real quick, just kind of do any thoughts you might have on the transition from the political landscape, anything that you're watching it, thinking down in terms of positive or positive.","Yeah, so I mean the one thing we're looking at is on the demand side. I would say there's a few different opportunities that could come up as a result of the proposed stimulus that's out there. We have some heavy equipment business I think some of the COVID products could increase even further from a demand standpoint. Certainly, I think it bodes well for semi-cap as well, too. The other thing we're looking at on the other side of the equation is what happens with the tax landscape, and does that have any impact?",2550.717,2586.737,9,2021,1,0.301,3.203,0,-0.063,-0.584,0,0.5239999999999999,2.5889999999999995,0,0.1989999999999999,6.689,0,0.755,7.306999999999999,0,0.5319999999999999,7.901,0
"Yes, thanks. Just a question regarding the product or the component supply chain environment right now. You talked about inventory days up, Pat. We're hearing across the board of supply constraints in certain semiconductors and some passive components. Are you seeing that yet, and are your customers asking you to build inventory?","Yeah, so Matt, this is Steve. I'll take that one. First of all, there's a lot of news out there about the automotive market having shutdowns due to semiconductor shortages. And I just want to remind everybody, we don't do automotive. So in terms of our end market impact, there's nothing there. Specifically, what's causing those challenges in automotive is a tightening in semiconductor components, and we are seeing some of that. We don't foresee any issues here in the fiscal second quarter. From an inventory standpoint, we feel pretty comfortable where we're at. We do start to see lead times start to extend, a little pricing pressure here and there, so it's definitely real from our perspective. I feel actually pretty comfortable. Our teams definitely have to work harder through these periods, but at these times is when our teams have outperformed, and so I'm pretty optimistic in terms of what our teams will be able to do. The one part that I get a little nervous on is looking at those forecasts as we go into the back half of the year. If our customers start dropping in big demand, our ability to react and bring things in is really kind of the bigger challenge. And so we have been talking to our customers about inventory levels and what we're comfortable storing. Now, keep in mind, our customers are responsible for the inventory levels. Plexus doesn't speculate. So from our standpoint, it's really just working through with our customers where they need to be. And we do have some customers that have increased raw component inventories to be able to respond to upside demand in the back half of the year. And so, again, it's a mix with each customer, but we do see it coming a bit more But I think we're responding appropriately. And at this point, the teams are handling it really well. I'm at this, Pat. On the balance sheet, I just want to comment for the second quarter. We do expect a slight build in inventory dollars to the tune of about $20 million. But I had guided the midpoint of our cash cycle being down compared to the fiscal first quarter. And some of that's driven by inventory days just because of the increase in revenue we expect in the second quarter.",2632.222,2764.991,10,2021,1,0.4589999999999999,3.662,0,-0.062,-0.6459999999999999,0,0.4999999999999999,3.0889999999999995,0,0.739,7.428,0,0.7110000000000001,8.018,0,0.939,8.84,0
"Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then I did want to follow up on previous questions just regarding your guidance for next quarter and then for the year. As you said, a little bit different than you saw a quarter ago. But when I add the numbers, you know, the revenue, I don't think consensus for fiscal 21 is going to change much. And you're going to be looking at, obviously, tougher comps at the back half when you had a really, really strong last September quarter. But it sounds like the setup for 2022, as Adam indicated, is good. I guess my question is, should we start thinking about a return to that 9% to 11% revenue growth target? And in terms of margins, I know that in the past when you've had some really big ramp-ups quarter to quarter, there's been some costs and some margin headwinds. So how should we think about, you know, growth versus the margin in the mix of the business?","Yeah, I think maybe I'll start with 22, and then there's a couple other topics I want to hit as well. But, I mean, certainly too early to talk about 22 and give any sort of, guide or color, but I think it's setting up to be a really good year. When you look at the factors and the catalysts that I talked about earlier, I think that's quite good. And I mean, kind of backing up to 21, I mean, I would say, well, it's not 9 to 12. It still sets up to be a pretty good year or a growth year from a revenue standpoint. But the EPS leverage, I mean, you start to do the math on that, it looks pretty good. So I think that's a compelling story for fiscal 21. And, Matt, you mentioned margin headwinds with transitions. We always have those transitions going on, so I wouldn't say that's necessarily impacting margins. We do have the Thailand facility that's going to be ramping up, and it typically takes a few quarters before a new site reaches corporate averages. And then the other item we're watching is travel expenses. They've been obviously very depressed, and we expect some return at some point, but I don't think we'll get back to the levels we were at pre- COVID. So monitoring that, that could be a slight headwind for us.",2825.745,2913.061,11,2021,1,0.401,4.063,0,-0.06,-0.706,0,0.634,3.723,0,0.945,8.373,1,0.826,8.844,0,0.967,9.807,0
"Okay, great. And just last quick question, just regarding costs, Pat, you didn't call out a COVID-related cost. Is that just sort of embedded in your model now, or do you see any changes there?","um so for the first quarter it was around two million dollars so it's starting to taper down we do expect expenses in the the latter quarters probably to the tune of a million to a million and a half um when you look year over year last year fiscal 20 we had about 10 million dollars this year we would think that's about six million dollars so about four million dollars lower there um on another area of cost are healthcare costs internal. We're depressed with last year with elective procedures being down. We expect those to be up. And that pretty much offsets the benefit we're seeing from a COVID expense reduction. We expect healthcare costs to be up about $4 million this year.

Could you expand on what drove that decision, whether it was something that was already in the works or maybe if there was a change in thinking due to circumstances? And then I had a follow-up.","Yeah, this is Steve. In some of these challenging times, I think customers do question their supply chain strategies more, and so I think the conversations we're having right now are things that customers were considering, but I think the COVID situation is pushing them to move a little bit quicker. So not a big strategic shift on – I mean, a big strategic shift on their part, but I think the timing of COVID is just helping expedite things.",3013.372,3036.189,14,2021,1,0.357,4.83,0,-0.0719999999999999,-0.9049999999999998,0,0.2029999999999999,4.045,0,-0.315,8.844,0,0.6960000000000001,10.772,0,0.726,12.062,0
"And those shifts would be done with, like, Their current facilities would be utilized by the customer. You'd be outsourcing into your existing facilities, like their strategy around their own plant and equipment is what?","Yes, they would exit their facilities, and we would do that one of two ways. One is either to just move the facility entirely at the moment that they exit it or do what we call a manage in place is where we'd manage it for 18 months, 24 months, and then transfer it.

"And then just on the new logo wins, can you just talk about the competitive environment around those six wins, how much of it was due to just sort of where you guys play versus maybe seeing competition from small or large teams? EMS providers?","Yeah, the competitive environment is about the same. I mean, we run into the big guys all the time, and there's always smaller players involved as well. And so I don't think with these situations or with COVID, there's been a big fundamental shift in the competitive landscape.

So I think, you know, our heavy equipment business and our industrial sector could benefit, our energy business and our industrial sector could benefit. I think that COVID, particularly around test, could benefit from a market standpoint, and semi-cap is potentially only going to get stronger. So maybe I'll pass it off to Pat, too, for some comments.

"Hi, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter, and congrats, Sean and Heather. A lot of good questions asked already, but I just wanted to get a sense more of your revenue guidance for the second half. You say it's sort of going to be in line with the fiscal second quarter expectations. Does that assume that electives still stay sort of suppressed, so there could be a surprise upside in the second half that comes back more forcefully?","Yeah, it does. I mean, basically, it looks at the environment as being more or less what it is today, perhaps even maybe call it a little softer than what we're seeing for the fiscal second quarter, because we saw a lot of drop in upside demand that impacted the second quarter that doesn't necessarily impact Q3 and Q4 at this point. So there's a lot of potential, I think, for for opportunities within the second half.

"Okay, thank you. And I think you did this a little bit already about the gross margin and ramping new projects might be pressing that because you're guiding to quite – you had a good performance this quarter and you're guiding for the second quarter to remain relatively high. So how should we think about that going forward?","Yeah, well, Go ahead, Pat. Yeah, well, I was going to say, as Todd said, I mean, from an operating margin standpoint, we've been really pleased with the last three quarters. So hitting 5% or above would be our target. Expenses we're kind of monitoring, Anya, would be travel expenses and health care costs. Those are things that could be potential headwinds for us. But trying to achieve that 5% or above would be our target. Yeah, and we don't see really a significant drag from new program ramps in the future. I mean, we're somewhat always ramping new programs, and we think the leverage we can get from the other business can offset the costs or the inefficiencies of new program ramps.",3395.394,3444.655,20,2021,1,0.408,7.19,0,-0.066,-1.3179999999999998,0,0.5690000000000001,6.044,0,0.949,10.594,0,0.8109999999999999,15.71,0,0.962,17.521,0
"Okay, thank you. And then lastly, in the Army and Defense this quarter, you alluded to some issues with ramping new programs causing the shortfall there. Can you just elaborate on that and talk about how that's going to happen in the coming quarters?","Sure. The space program I mentioned had some delays in the ramp. As you can imagine, programs that are going into outer space, there's a lot of stringent requirements. From a manufacturing process standpoint, We're working with the customer on some strengthening of those requirements, and it slowed down production. We believe we've worked through those and have alignment with the customer on what the requirements are, and so I wouldn't expect it to impact it going forward.",3461.236,3485.848,21,2021,1,0.299,7.489,0,-0.068,-1.386,0,0.05,6.093999999999999,0,0.092,10.686,0,0.838,16.548,0,0.934,18.455,0

"Hi, good morning. Um, a couple of questions. Um, just with, yeah, I wanted to just focus on the, the supply chain constraints that you're alluding to. And I assume this is all, uh, tied to what we've been hearing about for a while now. Uh, just the chip shortages. Is that basically, uh, representing the bulk of these constraints?","Yes, I would, uh, this is Steve. Um, If you look across the commodities, we track about 60 commodities as a company, and it is a pretty widespread challenge that I think everybody is facing. It's not just us. And if you look at those 60 commodities, there's about 85% of them that we've identified as either pricing increasing or lead time challenges associated with them. So it is a broad-based supply chain challenge. I think our teams are doing an exceptional job working through it, but it's not anything outside of what you've probably heard from other companies in the industry in general. Got it.",1828.327,1865.484,1,2021,2,0.369,0.369,0,-0.0649999999999999,-0.0649999999999999,0,0.172,0.172,0,0.715,0.715,0,0.84,0.84,0,0.962,0.962,0
"So if we think about, you know, what at least we're hearing out there is that it doesn't sound like this is going to be resolved anytime soon. And so I guess what I'm wondering is, you know, is there a potential risk that this remains a headwind in Q4 for you guys? You know, at the same time that we're hearing about an economy that could grow 6% or more in the U.S. And so it seems like you've got, you know, the potential risk. for customers to, you know, potentially accelerate activity. And so I'm wondering how we should think about that as we, you know, think about Q4 and even early next year.","Yeah, so it's reasonably comfortable as we look at what our forecast from our customers have been in terms of our ability to secure supply and produce for them. Like I mentioned it last quarter, I think one of the things that we were concerned about and we are seeing is customers that start dropping in upside demand within the quarter, within lead time. It is. It's more difficult for us to deliver for that, and we have a fair amount of revenue that we could capture in the quarter if we could get supply chain. So from my viewpoint, it's more about our ability to capture upside than it is our concern about downside. The one thing I'd add to that too, Jim, and this is Todd, is as we look to Q4 and as we look to Fiscal 22, we're bullish about the demand that's out there, and our supply chain guys are working to clear all the challenges that we have out there. But there's solid demand, and our ability to execute on the demand that comes in under more normal circumstances is as strong as ever. The challenge becomes when you're dropping in things inside the quarter or inside the lead time of certain components that are out there right now.",1904.979,1975.778,2,2021,2,0.483,0.852,0,-0.077,-0.1419999999999999,0,0.337,0.509,0,0.6799999999999999,1.395,0,0.872,1.712,0,0.957,1.919,0
"Got it. Just a final question. I'm wondering if you called out this aftermarket services engagement. I'm wondering if you could say anything more about that with respect to size, type of customer, and whether this is maybe an area that you think you're going to be able to further leverage your capabilities with maybe other customers like this.","Yeah, we're really excited about this one, Jim. And it's a healthcare customer is what I'll say. I won't get into any details of the product lines. But it's across all three of our regions. It's many different sites. It's significant from a revenue standpoint. So we've talked about aftermarket and our ability in the longer term to be able to grow it to 5% to 10% of revenue. I think this is a good step in that direction. I mean, this opportunity by itself could get us to a pretty meaningful level of revenue within aftermarket, and especially when you put it on top of the the book of business that's already within our aftermarket offering.",1996.705,2039.275,3,2021,2,0.4559999999999999,1.3079999999999998,0,-0.071,-0.2129999999999999,0,0.6599999999999999,1.169,0,0.612,2.007,0,0.7699999999999999,2.482,0,0.959,2.878,0
"Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid quarter. I guess my first question really is around some of the shortages you're seeing, and you provided some color there. Just kind of curious what your thoughts are in terms of how that may be impacting your customers. So beyond the manufacturing process, but once it gets to your customers, do you get a sense that maybe they're facing any shortage issues that may be constraining their ability to sell into their markets?","I would say, you know, typically a lot of the stuff that we're doing is pretty close to a finished good. Our customers do add value in some areas. So I don't believe that they're getting significant constraints beyond what, as long as we're able to deliver, I think for the most part they're able to deliver. With that said, I mean, obviously there's some customers that have secondary things and other products that they add to it. But I think the biggest challenge has been more on the electronics than other things at this point. The other thing I'd add to on that, David, is we're seeing really strong demand from our semiconductor capital equipment customers, of course, because they're the ones who can help the fabs and the manufacturers get beyond the situation that we're in right now.",2080.463,2130.417,4,2021,2,0.47,1.7779999999999998,0,-0.074,-0.2869999999999999,0,0.5389999999999999,1.7079999999999995,0,0.072,2.079,0,0.669,3.151,0,0.955,3.833,0
"That definitely makes good sense. And I guess the tone from your customers from their in-demand, are they seeing, I guess, are you seeing, I guess, the drop in orders at the same pace you did at the previous quarter? How are you thinking about in-demand? Is that accelerating or what has that pace been like, I guess?","The demand environment itself is just really strong right now. I mean, if we look at what we saw in the And the out-quarters one quarter ago versus today, it's completely different. I mean, particularly within our industrial sector where semiconductor capital equipment and communications are very strong, and then in healthcare where elective is coming up very rapidly. So we're seeing major demand increases across those two sectors in particular.",2147.942,2175.526,5,2021,2,0.418,2.196,0,-0.0689999999999999,-0.3559999999999997,0,0.379,2.087,0,0.299,2.378,0,0.883,4.034,0,0.94,4.773,0
"Great. And then lastly for me maybe is the industrial segment is an area that we thought would see a nice uptick as we kind of got through COVID here, and it seems like maybe some of the automation is finally becoming a bigger play there. What is your sense in terms of that segment in particular and just the demand that you're seeing now? Do you think this is something that maybe we're in the beginning of a new cycle for some of the industrial, especially on automation, or do you think this is maybe just a blip and it settles down as we get into next year?","Yes, I'll just hit specifically on the warehouse and factory automation, and then maybe Steve can provide a little bit more color on the sector overall. But that's one of the areas I'm going to highlight a bit in my script. We're very excited about a few different program ramps that we have going on in there, and we think it's a huge secular growth market for us with just outstanding potential. It's particularly an F-22 type event for us, not a Not really an F21 in a major way, but we're very excited about what's happening within warehouse and factory automation. Yeah, I mean, just to reiterate what Todd said, I think we've got two things going on. One is that we are winning new customers and taking market share in that space, and that market space is also set for growth. And so you've got both things going and working in the right direction. So as Todd said, we're pretty optimistic about that as we get into 22.

"Okay, thanks. Todd, I just wanted to start on winds and funnel, another healthy quarter here. Maybe you could touch on the composition of the incremental winds from a profitability profile basis. As those layer in, what sort of kind of gross and operating margin profile on that incremental contribution? And then secondly, for Steve, Just kind of on this topic, from an operating standpoint, recognize these wins are healthy. What lanes do the salespeople have to work within, and maybe why not expand those lanes given margins are at record levels, economic return is so far in excess of cost of capital? You talked about passing on a large outsourcing opportunity, so just wanted to ask from an operating standpoint, why not expand the lanes? Thank you.","Yeah, so from a standpoint of the margin profile of the new wins, I would say they fit nicely within our model. And what we do is we give our sector leaders the leeway to be able to manage their portfolio as a book of business. And, you know, they know that as they bring in certain new business, it'll be at lower margins as it typically is as it ramps up, and particularly with new customers. But then they layer on top of that some better margin business and, in essence – run a portfolio that meets their targets. So we give them a lot of leeway, but in general, they're good at targeting business that fits the type of financial model that we want to deliver. Yeah, and I'll take the second part. The sector teams have a pretty significant amount of leeway in terms of what they want to do. And for me, a couple examples are, you know, the healthcare team, life sciences team going after robotic surgery, the industrial team going after automation and warehouse automation and the aerospace and defense sector going after space products. And so they're quite free to go chase where they believe the future business is going to go as long as it falls in line with our overall Plexus strategy. On the specific opportunity you talked about, I'm glad you brought it up because to me it really demonstrates the, I'd say, the discipline that the teams have. In this specific example, The customer is switching more from a hardware platform to more of a software platform. That's where their industry is going. And to be honest with you, this one would have probably been a nice revenue pop for the next year or two, but we really saw that that end market was getting a bit – probably going to be a bit more commoditized, and the volume of products they need is going to go down. And so although we would have chased it, won it, and it would have been margin challenged in the beginning, we also believe that it wasn't necessarily the right thing long-term either. And so It's sometimes always hard to walk away from revenue and an opportunity, but to me it's really the impressive part of what our teams have been able to do to go, quite frankly, chase the right business and the stuff that isn't right for us they walk away from. So I was pretty impressed with their decision. One additional thing I'd add on that as well, Adam, is when we think about our markets and our pricing, we believe that at our financial model our markets support the low double-digit growth target that we have.",2316.484,2455.571,8,2021,2,0.552,3.321,0,-0.0579999999999999,-0.5309999999999997,0,0.635,3.476,0,0.877,3.761,0,0.893,6.16,0,0.973,7.295,0
"Yes, that makes sense and helpful, Cole. I appreciate it. Maybe just a follow-up for Pat. One of the other impressive stories that you've driven so far at the company is the OPEX trends. Ratios have improved significantly. You've had productivity gains, expense management. I remember years ago trying to get below 5% operating expenses at percent of revenue, and you're now pushing to the low 4% range. Just talk about the trajectory from here on OpEx. You know, is the right way to think about the normalized model still mid-4%? Has it become lower than that? Is there additional opportunity? Just maybe just walk us through the OpEx line. Thank you.","Sure. Yeah, I think there is opportunity. I think we're still going to be operating within this four to four and a half range, though, depending on investments we make in certain quarters. But I think it does have the ability to trend down, especially if we're driving double-digit top-line growth, we can really leverage our OpEx expenses to see some improvement.

"Hi. I guess I had another question just on the component supply situation. During the quarter, you guys actually reduced inventories, even though things were sort of tightening up. So I know you don't speculate on inventory, but why weren't you able to convince some of your customers to maybe sort of get ahead of the curve so that you maybe have opportunities to do some upside, to produce some upside? And then I had a follow-up question.","Yeah, I would say that some of our customers did get ahead of it. We were definitely building inventory for a few customers, especially in semiconductor capital equipment. And as Pat talked about, the deposits that some of our customers put, they were asking us to get ahead of the financial forecast as they saw it coming. I would say some other industries, specifically like the elective procedures and healthcare life sciences, it's coming back a little bit quicker than what people thought. And so, you know, there is a question about you know, how quickly they should have brought in inventory and working with them. I can tell you that in our aerospace customers, we are having those conversations with some of our aerospace customers now about starting to procure inventory for the eventual return of that market. So it's a case-by-case situation, and we are doing that, and we're working effectively with customers in many cases. Other cases, It's really about a belief in terms of what their forecasts are going to be. So I think we've got a good balance, and we're able to do that. In terms of inventories, the dollar numbers, from a dollar standpoint, it's up. Days were down as we looked through the quarter here. So you will see inventories continue to build here for a little bit before we start to bleed them off as the markets clear up a little bit.",2562.743,2639.035,11,2021,2,0.481,4.31,0,-0.068,-0.7219999999999996,0,0.5289999999999999,4.629,0,0.6619999999999999,5.068,0,0.873,8.157,0,0.968,9.735,0
"Great, that's helpful. And then just on the labor shortages, you mentioned this sort of headwind. Can you just sort of go into some more details on whether that was your own facilities or further up or down the supply chain and how you expect that to clear, given that, you know, other regions outside the U.S. still seem to be struggling with COVID? Thanks.","Yeah, so it was related to our facilities, and basically we had a number of positive cases that allowed us to lose some time late in the quarter. And, I mean, generally it's just one of those things that we've been managing through and been managing very effectively. The thing why it became an issue this quarter is because it was so late in the quarter there wasn't enough time to recover.

"Another follow-up regarding the supply constraints. Could you quantify any missed upside opportunity? You talked, Steve, about some headwinds in terms of revenue on SemiCap, even though it sounds like customers are trying to get ahead of it. Are we talking about like a 5% opportunity missed? Could you just quantify that?","Sure. The upside that we saw on the fiscal second quarter that customers dropped in was probably $10 to $15 million. But as quickly as it got dropped in, there was no way we were going to realize that.

I would say that we do believe some of the demand is going to push, and we do see it building in future quarters. One of the conversations we're having with customers is how much of it is perishable. I would say it's a little early to quantify exactly that entire $40 million to $50 million going to be realized in future quarters, versus how much is perishable. But I guess my message to you is that some of it's going to push, some of it's going to be perishable, but we haven't really been able to quantify it completely yet.",2761.822,2790.427,14,2021,2,0.327,5.218999999999999,0,-0.071,-0.9339999999999996,0,0.328,5.028,0,0.688,6.539,0,0.838,10.588,0,0.907,12.368,0

Or is there any signs, for instance, MRO picking up or any sort of indicators that that give you some more confidence that it's going to be, you know, a faster recovery?","Yeah. So what we expect is this quarter to be kind of somewhat around the bottom, and then it starts to pick up a bit. What we're seeing pick up right now is MROs. as well as business jets is picking up rather nicely right now.

And lastly, just a quick housekeeping for Pat regarding how we should be thinking about interest expense and tax rate beyond what you're guiding to for the June quarter, sort of guiding or modeling Flattish in our quarters? Does that make sense?

Tax rate is real uncertainty at this point.

Just your thoughts on the reasons behind the more favorable pricing environment in your view? and how to continue to stay disciplined on pricing and your expectations over the year and longer term for the industry?","In general, there's just a lot more discipline in the pricing environment and the current environment than there had been maybe previously within our industry. So I think that's good for everybody. I mean, of course, there's a lot of newer management teams that are in the various competitors that we have, which I think that That's factored into it quite a lot, and it's been a good environment from a pricing standpoint. But, you know, I mean, in ways, though, partly for us, too, we've tried to stake out differentiated positions where perhaps we're not – it's not solely a price or a price competition that's going on, but it's more of a capabilities competition that's going on.

"Gotcha. And then as we kind of think about post-COVID, you know, do you expect some of your existing customers to kind of accelerate the shift to outsource manufacturing? And, you know, how are those conversations evolving? And then same question for new customers and new logos. And then, you know, anything you want to call out in Asia and the particular strength there?","In terms of our customers outsourcing, I think any time there's a, a disruption, whether it's COVID or a recession or something like that, I think customers in general take a look at their sourcing strategies and adjust them. And so we are seeing a little bit of an uptick in customers looking at their strategies. The one Todd talked about for aftermarket services is one where a customer looked at it and said, hey, we're going to start outsourcing this. I talked about a win where a customer is transitioning from internal production to external production. And so anytime there's a disruption in it causes people to – we see an uptick in those kind of decisions. And so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit more as we go forward. In terms of APAC, I mean, our HPAC team just continues to execute really, really well. The strategy that we have over there is working well. Our expansion into Thailand is to add capacity in Southeast Asia as we see our facilities in Malaysia start to get more full. And so I would say it's kind of steady as it goes.

So any thoughts on the kind of annual free cash flow guide? Is there some conservatism baked in there? Thanks.","Yeah, like I said, Paul, some of it's going to depend on timing of capital expenditures for Thailand. We've got $23 million in this year, and some of that could push to next year, which would improve our free cash flow. we're going to be procuring quite a bit for the growth we expect in fiscal 22.

When that is ramping and you expect the margins to be a little bit pressured, right, is there any other parts of your business that you can push to make up for that pressure?","Yeah, I think in general the answer is yes, Anya, and we don't anticipate our margins to suffer as the Thailand facility is coming online. There's a couple of factors in that, too. I mean, one, and Steve had already mentioned the performance of the APAC team But our APAC team is incredibly efficient at launching new facilities and bringing them to corporate-level profitability. So we have high confidence they'll be able to do it in very short order.

I mean, the manufacturing winds have actually been quite strong over the past couple of quarters. If I look back over fiscal 20 and into 21 here, you know, for the most part, we've been at $250 million or north of it for quite some time.

It doesn't, as Todd highlighted, it doesn't support maybe the corporate growth goals that we want.

"Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions. You highlighted the fact that the industrial wind's was down in the quarter sequentially. And you're also suggesting a recovery in fiscal Q4. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing there. And I guess the broader question I'm having is, do you have any sense if the supply chain issues that we've all been hearing about are beginning to or potentially impacting WINS in this or any other areas of the business, just because it's been so broadly based across different market verticals, what we're seeing in terms of supply chain. And a follow-up on that is I'm wondering if there's any way of quantifying potentially what type of headwind you might be anticipating from component availability in Q4. Thank you.","Sure. Maybe I'll hit the second part first, which was focused on the supply chain impact on WINS. I don't believe that the supply chain right now is impacting the funnel or the wins rate. Really couldn't correlate anything happening there. So I think we're at normal levels. Specifically as it relates to the industrial wins in Q3, I wouldn't read too much into that either. We do not measure the teams by a quarterly number. For us, it doesn't really matter whether we win it at the end of the last day of the quarter or the beginning of the next quarter. And so we don't incentivize the teams to try and close something to meet a quarterly metric. That's why we focus quite heavily on the trailing four quarter wins number. So it was a softer quarter, but like I said, I expect Q4 to come back to a healthy level. So again, I wouldn't read anything too much into that either. In terms of headwinds as we, in terms of the revenue that we're forecast that we have in front of us for Q4, there is a sizable customer forecast that we're unable to achieve in Q4 due to component supply chains. you know, quite frankly, you rolled up the numbers would be in excess of a hundred million dollars with that said, um, even if we could procure a hundred million dollars with the components, then we'd have to start talking about the labor and the manufacturing capacity to be able to do that. So, um, so from an overall standpoint, um, there's a lot of demand out there.

The expansion of the new relationship that you highlighted, this is on the medical side, the health care side. And I'm wondering what may be driving that and to what extent you're really beginning to see traction with this in some of your other areas of the business. Thank you.","Yeah, so you're correct, Jim. The new relationship is on the healthcare side, and it has the potential, or it will be quite substantial. I mean, we've talked about it a couple of quarters in a row, and both quarters had meaningful programs that were launching for this customer. And what I would say about the AMS business is right now we have business across all three of our sectors, and But clearly we're gaining the most traction within our healthcare business, and I think it has to do with a lot of our regulatory capabilities that we have within the healthcare life sciences space.

In terms of M109, the efficiencies you've been driving there, As you get back to 100% capacity, how are those efficiencies going to play out, and are you going to be able to still benefit from those?","Yeah, specifically about the efficiencies, I mean, the efficiencies are being done or being achieved because the team is working, of course, exceptionally hard and probably at a pace that's not long-term sustainable. So we are learning things, and some of those things will basically be used into the future in terms of how we can be more efficient, but I think thinking that we're going to run at a 15% above, you know, where our work levels is probably not a realistic thing ongoing, but we are, like I said, learning a few things about how to improve the facilities as we go forward.

Is that still achievable, or could you improve that with these new systems, or how should we think about that?","Yeah, it's Pat. Yeah, I think you're right. We are at a high point right now, and as we look into fiscal 22 and move through the quarters, I want to see inventory getting back to the low 90 days, and that would equate to an overall cash cycle in the mid to low 70s.

"Matt Sheeran Yes, thanks. Just a question regarding the margins and you're guiding up sequentially relatively nicely and leverage on that revenue. But it's still you're still talking down from the peak levels of what 5.5 percent operating margin, 10 percent or so. gross margin and relative to the revenue upswing. So are there some still costs related to COVID labor costs in Malaysia, things like overtime? Steve, you talked about the fact that you're able to basically be at full production levels despite the fact that you're still at 80% or lower at labor levels. So are there some costs there that go away at some point and you'll get back to those peak margins?","Yeah. So, Matt, I'll start on this, and Steve and Pat may want to jump in at some point as well, too. But there's a few different factors that are impacting Q4 margins. And we talked, one, about program ramps, or in particular around the AMS program ramp. And we typically don't spend a lot of time talking about program ramps impacting margin because it's part of what we just build into doing the business. But this is a bit unique in that it's ramping incredibly fast, and we're adding a lot of resources very rapidly. So there is a bit of an impact there. There is the inefficiencies that are occurring yet in our Penang operations that are impacting Q4, and also just some of the intense supply chain efforts that are ongoing right now to secure components. So those are all having an impact on the cost structure. But when we look further out, we do believe the margins we've achieved in the past are achievable in the future. And Pat talked about how we'll be discussing our annual operating plan and our long-range plan with our board next month. We'll come out with a new margin target. It'll be somewhere north of 5% is what I'll say as a precursor to that. Okay. Hey, Matt, one thing I'd add is you had asked about COVID costs. Just to give you some perspective in Q3, we had about 1.6 million in COVID related costs. We expect that to be around 1.3 million in the fourth quarter. Seeing some reduction there as our testing that we're doing of employees will go down as more employees are vaccinated. So we see those costs come down a bit in the fiscal fourth quarter. And I'll add one point because Anya kind of asked about it as well in terms of Panang efficiencies. I think the one thing to keep in mind is although we have 60% or 80% of the workforce on site that are generating, you know, outperforming and generating higher efficiencies, the reality is we're still paying 100% of the employees even if they're not at work. So our cost structure hasn't really changed as it relates to the labor force there. Yeah, and then I just add one last thing on the operating margin target. As Todd said, we're going to talk through that with our board next month, but if we would come up with a goal, say, of mid-5%, really important to keep in mind that that's a gap operating margin, and when you add back stock-based compensation, we'd be north of 6% on an apples-to-apples basis with our peers.",2203.169,2361.508,5,2021,3,0.445,2.116,0,-0.0579999999999999,-0.3309999999999997,0,0.37,2.401,0,0.963,4.122,0,0.892,4.199,0,0.961,4.81,0
"Understood. Okay. Thanks for that. And then another question on inventory. I guess the fact that you're able to build as much as you did in the quarter, given the supply constraints. Somewhat surprising, although I guess that's primarily a function of the fact that you had lower production levels because of the Malaysia issue, so you were bringing components in. So I guess the question is, are you seeing areas where things are opening up where you're able to build some inventory, or do you think a lot of this is just kind of tied to backlog that's been building and you're just going to run that through?","Yeah, it's probably more of the latter. We don't necessarily do the component constraint issues starting this off until we get into fiscal or calendar 22 even. So we do expect it to be a continued constrained market. Hence the reason we are bringing in a little bit more inventory. We also have customers that are a little bit leery about losing, even though there may be from a forecast standpoint, we have a little bit of time to bring it in. The lead times are still there. there's more and more customers that are a little bit leery about not having the inventory on hand because they're afraid that it might disappear for some reason. And so we have some customers that are asking us, even though we could potentially get it with any time to bring it in now, and that's where we're working with them on deposits to help offset that.

"Okay, thanks. Just a quick question for either Steve or Todd on the supplier quality issue. It sounds like you said that this is resolved, but I'm just trying to get a sense for what percent of customers are using this part, or is this more of a custom part for that one customer? Just really trying to get a sense of the risk of broader contagion across the customer base from this, or is this really just a one-off?","Yeah, it's a one-off.

"Okay, got it. So I really wanted to ask about the fiscal 22 comments, Todd. You talked about double-digit growth, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think you had been talking about double-digit growth in the past as we think on a go-forward basis. So I'm wondering... If we add this non-perishable demand on top of that double-digit growth and be more like mid-teens growth, or is there something missing with that logic?","Yeah, it was intentionally vague with double-digit. I mean, what I would say is when we think of our growth number, we're thinking of really what would it be, 22 over 21. So it takes into account the adjustments. But what I can say is, well – We're early in the cycle, and it's a long ways to even the start of F-22, let alone the end of F-22, so things could change. But we wouldn't be talking about double-digit growth unless our forecast comfortably supported that level, is what I would say. And when you think about the dislocated revenue, here's the way I would look at it. I mean, we had, with the way Q3 ended, we had about... 80 million that I would call dislocated because we performed a bit better than we thought we were going to. Some of that, a small amount is recovered in Q4. There's a small amount that's perished, and you can think of about maybe 50 million or so rolling into the first half of F22.",2550.973,2614.613,9,2021,3,0.352,3.383,0,-0.0659999999999999,-0.5989999999999995,0,0.0069999999999999,2.615,0,0.908,5.614,0,0.852,7.439,0,0.966,8.584,0
"Got it. That's helpful. Just last one for me to clarify on the near-term margin commentary. So you have the AMS business ramp. I think in the prepared comments you talked more about that being a Q1 impact. It sounds like some of it may spill into Q4 as well. I'm just trying to understand how much cost is associated with that. Maybe a way to think about it is, you know, how to build off of this 5% or so at the midpoint guide for Q4 as we think about Q1. Are there more, you know, headwinds related to the AMS ramp or tailwinds related to Malaysia utilization? Should we be building, you know, higher or lower off that? Thanks.","Yeah, Adam, I can take that. So we're doing the investment in the fiscal fourth quarter, and then the revenue will start towards the end of the quarter and into fiscal 22.

"Okay, so that 10 basis points should be recovered throughout the course. I'm just thinking for Q1 of next year, it sounds like there's more tailwinds versus Q4 sequentially. Okay, got it.","Thank you. To maybe help understand the ramp, if you look at a circuit card that's ramping, you're typically, there's not a lot of labor involved, and it's more about just procuring the components, and we typically have the staff to build more circuit-level assemblies. When you're looking at aftermarket services, it's service and repair services. So it's more about training people to do the service and repair. So the cost that we're talking about doing is we have to add a significant amount of operators and technicians and train them on how to service and repair before we can actually start doing the work.

"Thanks. I had a big picture question just on the new wins and how you're going about it. It looks like there's been a bit of a step up on sort of the average size of the wins over the last couple of years, more like six or seven million per win versus five or six in the prior two years. And I'm just curious how you would sort of describe why that's happened, whether it's been circumstance, sort of, an ability to go after bigger wins and how you think about sort of investing in that front end machine to drive, you know, wins in the future. Do you scale that up more? Do you think you can target higher and higher wins per, you know, average size wins, et cetera? And then I had a follow-up.","Yeah, so your math on the average wins is correct. We've seen a bit of an uptick over the years into that magnitude and I would say that it is part of a little bit of a conscious effort to focus on bigger opportunities, but we don't necessarily exclude anything from a size standpoint. I know that some of our competitors have had thresholds where they say they will only chase a certain size opportunity. For us, it's more about the partnership with the customer. And I think as our relationships have continued to get stronger, we are seeing bigger opportunities across the board. So I don't expect significant increases in the average size in the coming years, but it doesn't surprise me that they will pick up. Yeah, just to add a bit, too, around investing in our customer-facing team, Steve, that's something that we continue to make pretty significant investments in. We have Of course, we have our new business development team as well as our existing customer team. And the existing customer a bit scales with revenue is the way to think of that. The new business development team we get additional leverage on, but we still continue to invest in there. And one of the things that I'd point out is just the progress that's been made in that team, and that's being reflected in the new logos that we've been talking about. So we've had 17 already this fiscal year A typical year might be 10 to 12 new logos. So we've done a great job of bringing in some new talent, leveraging some existing talent within that organization, building out our processes within the new business development effort of targeting new customers, and it's paying off right now.",2782.923,2884.874,12,2021,3,0.517,4.48,0,-0.064,-0.7979999999999994,0,0.5519999999999999,3.156,0,0.952,7.888,0,0.836,9.819,0,0.971,10.94,0
"Great. That's really interesting. And then just as a follow-up, Pat, can you I don't think you talked about it this way, but you said that engineering services help margins. Can you put a little bit of math around that, like how much of a benefit it was, I don't know, quarter over quarter, year over year, however you want to talk about it?","Yeah, I mean, we really don't break that out, Steve. If I had to look at the different components we had around lower health care costs, better engineering, and the productivity of You know, maybe it's a third, a third, a third. We haven't really done the math behind it, but that kind of feels right to me that not any one of those three was really dominating the improvement. They're probably pretty equally spread among the three. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. Thank you.

"Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple. On aerospace and defense, a nice surge in wins this quarter. Can you expand on the strength there? As we head into the next 12 months, you have relatively easier comps in that segment and nice momentum in wins. How should we think about the overall growth as we navigate through the next 12 months in aerospace and defense?","Sure. The wins this quarter, obviously, yeah, very, very healthy size. And one of the things that I talked about in the script a bit was a large defense customer. It was an abnormally large opportunity that we won for defense size. And so that definitely helped push the number higher. And then as we've talked about, we are continuing to gain share in the commercial space part. And so we see a meaningful growth in that as we look through fiscal 22 with what we've been able to capture and expanding those relationships. So You know, with the outlook of commercial aerospace starting to rebound, we believe, pretty optimistic in terms of what the sector is going to look like for 2022. Yeah, what I'd say is we feel good about all three of our sectors for next year. Obviously, A&D gets a little bit easier, but we think they're all going to be strong growth sectors for us in fiscal 2022.",2976.256,3026.508,14,2021,3,0.51,5.247,0,-0.067,-0.9229999999999994,0,0.6719999999999999,3.896,0,0.909,8.95,0,0.929,11.217,0,0.971,12.427,0
"Okay, great. And then on CapEx, you know, a little lighter question. an expected injury queue, but, you know, kind of a big ramp in four queues seem to catch up. So are there any delays in, you know, Thailand facility? I think you've mentioned it's on track for next year. And then on the facility itself, is there even more emphasis on automation? How do we think about kind of contribution margin of that facility? I think you've mentioned the Malaysian facility kind of generates relatively higher margins. I assume given the kind of scale and size of that facility. But how do you expect the Thailand facility margins to kind of shake out? Thank you.","Sure. I'll answer the first part. Maybe Pat will jump into the second. In terms of the building, I'm actually generally impressed with the team's ability to keep the project on track. Where it's tracking right now is about a week or two behind what we planned a year ago. And the team's confident they can catch it back up. So from a From an expectation standpoint, we do expect the facility to be online in the fiscal third quarter of 2022. We are talking to a handful of customers right now, and there's some interest in, from a risk mitigation standpoint, to have some of our existing business from Penang move there to help basically build a more robust supply chain for those people. We have hired the GM for the site. He's actually an internal person. We've announced that, and he's building a team. So our plans are going really well. Yeah, and with the margin, Paul, typically, I mean, we'll see three, four quarters where it'll be a drag on margin just because of the business ramping up and putting new business in there. What we've got going for us is similar to the campus environment we have in Penang. We'll be utilizing a lot of the overhead structure we've got in Penang to help support Thailand. So I think Similar to what we saw when we put up our fifth facility in Penang is that the ramp to our corporate operating margin target was fairly quick. Again, like a three to four quarter period. So I don't think you're going to see much of an impact to the overall results because typically we do have facilities ramping at one point or another. So I wouldn't necessarily depress our overall margins just because we're going through a period of of ramping with Thailand.",3067.359,3170.123,15,2021,3,0.423,5.67,0,-0.0579999999999999,-0.9809999999999992,0,0.593,4.489,0,0.923,9.873,0,0.888,12.105,0,0.972,13.399,0

Thank you.,"When you consider, call it dots on the map, we're not necessarily looking to add new dots on the map. But with the growth projections that we have, I mean, it won't be too far out.

It's shaping up to be a strong growth year given the exceptional wins performance, the improved end markets we're seeing, and our participation in secular growth markets. We're also establishing new and higher baseline for our operating margin performance, which all position us well for strong EPS growth within the fiscal year.

"Hi. I guess two questions for me. First of all, when we think about all the supply chain pressures, which, like you pointed out, have gotten worse, hopefully some get better, how do you envision sort of business changing for you in how you work with the customers over, say, the next 12 to 18 months if we assume that these things are still an overhang in business? whether it's ports, logistics, et cetera. Can you sort of describe how you do that in a way that helps returns cash flows to normal, et cetera? Thanks.","Yeah, so, Steve, this is Todd. I'll get us started and then pass it over to either Steve or Pat if they want to add anything. But we have a lot of activity going on within the supply chain and on the customer front. in light of the pressures that are there today. And I like to bucket them into three different buckets, one being customer actions, the next being organizational actions, and the third being process improvements or process changes. And from a customer standpoint, we're working to get extended forecasts. Pat had mentioned deposits. We're also looking to get pre-approvals to be able to purchase components at perhaps elevated prices if we find them available in the market. as well as expansion of approved manufacturers lists within the bills and materials of our customers. So a great deal of activity going on on that front. From an organizational standpoint, we've added a number of supply chain leadership positions within the company. We have a group which we call supply chain operations, which takes the lead in a lot of the escalations within our supply chain. We've increased that by 50% with an overall add of about 20% into our supply chain. We've also added key account support for specific customers where we have a significant number of challenges to really try to drive the supply chain through those challenges. And then finally, from a process standpoint, a lot of automation going on from a standpoint of part searches and purchasing and revising our expedite system and even taking an approach which we call a war room situation where we get a team together and they drive with a great deal of intensity supply chain issues. So a number of things going on on all fronts. They're having an impact, but it takes time for it all to ripple through the supply chain.",1911.491,2024.457,1,2021,4,0.504,0.504,0,-0.067,-0.067,0,0.404,0.404,0,0.934,0.934,0,0.937,0.937,0,0.968,0.968,0
"Great. That covered – that was really thorough. And then just as a follow-up to that, just tied into the same issue, is how do we get confident around sort of your inventory days, whether this is the worst they're going to be like this quarter? Sure.","Yeah, Steve, I can take that. I think as we move into our fiscal second quarter, we will see inventory dollars increase as we ramp for future demand. Now, from a days perspective, I think we can keep our days relatively consistent with the fiscal first quarter guide. And then I think as we move through the back half of the year is when we can see days coming down to below where we ended the year for fiscal 2021. So I think that's the way, you know, right now it's projected to play out. A lot of that's dependent on the supply chain and what develops over the next few quarters.",2041.601,2088.684,2,2021,4,0.294,0.798,0,-0.065,-0.132,0,0.337,0.7410000000000001,0,0.398,1.332,0,0.746,1.683,0,0.964,1.932,0
"So, a follow-up first on the supply chain pressure. Todd, you went over three categories and how you are combating that. How should we think about that as we come out of this? How sustainable are those actions and how are they going to be more beneficial to you to come out of these challenges?","Yeah, I think they are sustainable improvements. I think when you look at Some of the process improvements that are in there, they really get to the everyday way to run the business. And I think when you look at some of the structural changes that we made within our supply chain organization, those will provide long-lasting benefits for us. Yeah, maybe just to add a little bit onto the situation with the supply chain, one way I think about it is we're talking to customers. They're looking for us to have inventory on hand versus just on order. Given some of the volatility, they want to de-risk the aspect of all of a sudden products disappearing. And so we've been asked by customers, and we have been bringing more inventory on hand than what would be normal. So I think as we go out over time, that will go back into the supply chain. Instead of being on hand, it will be basically on order. And then in terms of that, the processes and the things that we're putting in order to really understand where things are at in the supply chain the things that we're doing today to make sure that we have the inventory going into the next quarter or two, those tools and systems, you know, according to the improvements we make, will only improve the process as we get further down the path and get back to more of a normal supply chain environment.",2126.09,2201.986,3,2021,4,0.515,1.313,0,-0.068,-0.2,0,0.5379999999999999,1.279,0,0.72,2.052,0,0.909,2.592,0,0.975,2.907,0
"Thank you. And then in terms of the demand that you are leaving on the table that's being pushed out, how – can you quantify – How much of that do you think is going to be perishable, if at all, any?","Yeah, right now it's largely non-perishable, but obviously there's going to be a finite timeline on that. So it really, I think, is going to depend on when the supply chain at least starts to stabilize, if not improve. So we certainly saw a situation in this past quarter of the supply chain actually degrading as opposed to even stabilizing.

"Okay, thank you. And what do you see in terms of sort of labor and raw material inflation? You can pass on some of the raw material cost increases to your customers, right? But how does it work with labor, and how are you combating the labor constraints?","Yeah, you're correct. On the material side of the equation, those can be passed on to customers. In terms of labor... Some we are able to work with our customers on, others not. And I'd say right now the situation is a bit that we're carrying extra costs because if the material is free, then we believe we can go build it. So we don't want labor to be the next constraint. So we are discussing that with customers in terms of how much we're going to carry. And in some cases, they are covering additional fixed costs for us to basically maintain that labor.

"Okay, thank you. And then just one last on the supply chain constraints. Is there any business segment where it's more callous than any other?","No, I mean, it's pretty much across the board, Anya.

"Yes, thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask, again, regarding the supply constraint situation, you know, relative to your forward guidance, and I think you're looking at sequential growth in each of the quarters in FY22. So I guess the question is, how much confidence or visibility do you have in securing or procuring those components? in advance of that? And in some of the inventory build that you're seeing now, I mean, is that basically, you know, being set aside for Q2, Q3, et cetera?","Yeah, so I'll start here, Matt, and then maybe pass it along to Steve. But when we look at 22 and what the demand environment is versus the supply environment, I mean, obviously it's two very opposing forces that that we're looking at right now. And I would say it's difficult to answer with certainty how 22 is going to play out. Because when we look at the demand environment, our demand would support well over 20% growth. Now, supply obviously limits the ability to fulfill all that demand. But we're certainly pushing towards double-digit growth. And we believe that's achievable should the supply chain stabilize. and not degrade further from where it's at. But even with the challenge supply chain, we believe that we have sufficient materials being pipelined and sufficient visibility to the demand to drive this sequential improvements in revenue and operating margins throughout the fiscal year. And if I just maybe add on to that, some of the degradation we saw on supply chain was some of the larger semiconductor manufacturers basically doing a reset of their commits. And as they saw the situation continue to get more and more challenging, some of them just took a breath, stepped back, and realigned their commit schedule. And we saw, you know, quite frankly, we saw a few D commits come through that we were expecting on. Now, we anticipate and believe that, you know, with those major suppliers, they've done this once and they've gotten realigned. And so, I think the Our expectation is that the supply commits that we do get will be more stable going forward is part of it as well.",2375.741,2481.585,7,2021,4,0.422,2.557,0,-0.069,-0.4759999999999999,0,0.567,1.887,0,0.875,3.453,0,0.9,5.889,0,0.964,6.426,0
"Got it. And is there any concern that there may be an imbalance of inventory? Certainly some suppliers have been able to add capacity and meet orders where others aren't. So at some point, is there going to be sort of a reshuffling of your inventory, or do you want to just keep that on hand for the future? Sure.","I don't know that we'll see a reshuffle of our inventory. It goes back to when is it going to get utilized. And I think the dynamic you talk about is one that we're seeing. So we do some things in industrial automation where our orders, we're actually starting to procure the materials and it's starting to get line of sight. But the steel associated with going into the warehouse, there's some shortages on steel. And so although we may be able to produce the automation products, our end customer may not be able to actually do the install yet. And so to your point, I think as supply chain things starting to clear out over the next year or so here, we are going to see some things like that happen where other factors may come into play in terms of what's impacting the deliveries and the shipments.
