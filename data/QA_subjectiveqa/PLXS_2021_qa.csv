A couple of questions. I was wondering if you might be able to expand on the six new logos you added, if there's any color you can provide either on verticals or type of customer or program.",Steve Frisch,Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yes. So, Jim, this is Todd. I'll get us started, and I'll have Steve provide some of the details around the sectors and the opportunities. But The one thing I wanted to highlight about the new program wins that I think is significant, and I hope that people take away from this, is if you look at our business development approach, it's really to grow with existing customers, to find the right customers and then grow with those customers. And I talked about six new logos, and Steve talked about 14 new relationships. So that includes the six logos plus eight new divisions of existing logos. So when you look at this, we ??We get a new logo in, we transition it, we potentially add additional divisions, and we grow with each of those, the original division or logo as well as the expanded relationship that we have with the other divisions. So I wanted to point that out, and then I want to turn it over to Steve to get into a bit more detail. Sure, Jim. In terms of color, they were equally split across the sector. So there was two in industrials, two in healthcare, life sciences, and two in aerospace. And some of the Wednesday details that I went into highlighted some of them. The anesthesia program that I talked about in healthcare was one of them. The device that's used for advanced manufacturing process control was one of them, as well as the air purification system. And so that gives you a little bit more insight into it was a pretty good mixed across all three of the sectors.

But I wanted to go to that target that you're talking about for revenue of 9% to 12% growth. And clearly, last year was impacted unquestionably by COVID. And this year, you've got some moving parts as well. But I'm trying to get a sense What's given you that confidence about that 9% to 12% revenue growth? It sounds like it's the wins that are coming in. It's a question of when do you potentially see that conversion. It's obviously not going to, I think, happen this year.",Todd Kelsey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so I think, Jim, you're right on with your assessment about this year is that the 9 to 12 would be difficult in this year. And kind of the way I've characterized it in the release and in the script here is that if you do the math, it wouldn't add up to the 9 to 12. But there's a number of things that give us confidence that 9 to 12 is a success. a realistic and very achievable goal. And first of all, if we look backward looking over the period of 18 to 20, we were at 10%. So our sectors and our markets have shown that they can support that level of growth. Then if we look, and that includes last year with the pandemic and that number as well, I know as we go through our planning process and we do a bit of a bottoms-up planning, our teams, again, their results support our revenue growth goals. But there's really four factors that I think serve as catalysts for us as we go through fiscal 21 and into fiscal 22. First of all, we have the margin expansion and the sustainable margin expansion, which I think we're doing a nice job of showing that that's very achievable. Second, we've got the recovery of medical equipment used for elective procedures. And we're starting to see a hint of a sign of that right now, but I wouldn't say it's a recovery by any means. So there's great opportunity with that as we move forward. And there's also the increase in demand that we expect to see from commercial aerospace as we see travel upticks post the COVID vaccine rollout. So that may be an early 22 type event is what we're expecting. And then we have the new program ramps. And you saw the win success that we've had, the over billion-dollar trailing four-quarter funnel that we have. We've talked about some of the exciting new programs that have been long-term ramps within our healthcare life sciences sector. These all come to fruition in the F-22 issue. type timeframe here.

You've got new customers coming on. So what would be the offsets that I'm missing to make Q3 and Q4 effectively below normal seasonality?",Todd Kelsey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I think the issue, Adam, is that the visibility is just fairly limited right now. So I would say it's more of a situation as we're just not sure or we just don't know. And if you think back to ??A quarter ago when we had our call, we expected Q2 to be flat to Q1. I mean, obviously it's not. It's up substantially on the order of about $50 million. So we saw a lot of upside demand come in, particularly around the healthcare and in the industrial sector. So as our customers brought up forecasts, they just brought them up in the near term and not necessarily further out. So I'd say there's a lot of uncertainty to us as to whether we're going to see something similar as we move through the rest of the year or whether we won't.

And just maybe a longer-term question. You talked about the record over $3 billion funnel. You talked about committed to the 9% to 12% long-term revenue growth.

This is Steve. I'll try to handle that one. Obviously, trying to give guidance up to 22 would be a bit challenging, but looking at the market dynamics of where we're at, which gives us some optimism, is, you know, we look at commercial aerospace and, you know, we're strong in there. We've gained market share. We talked about the fact that we've been bouncing around the bottom and we see this down. And so we see that as a catalyst for growth in terms of what could happen into 22 as things start to recover. We've talked about the elective procedures in healthcare life sciences. We believe we're continuing to take market share. We're winning new logos. And we think there's a catalyst there to help accelerate some growth as things start to recover post-COVID. And then we've talked for the last couple of calls talking about an industrial team in semi-cap and with semiconductor capital equipment. The signals are out there that demand for semiconductor equipment or equipment and devices is only going to increase over time. Looking at our forecast and Todd's comments, we see these flattish kind of forecasts and then we see the short-term drop-ins. I think at some point there's a potential for that to turn into real forecast demand. You know, the optimism of the 9% to 12% is driven by those types of factors combined with the fact that we continue to win decent amounts of new business. And so I think that's why we're optimistic about the growth. Could it outperform?

Just a question regarding the product or the component supply chain environment right now. You talked about inventory days up, Pat. We're hearing across the board of supply constraints in certain semiconductors and some passive components. Are you seeing that yet, and are your customers asking you to build inventory?",Pat Germain,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so Matt, this is Steve. I'll take that one. First of all, there's a lot of news out there about the automotive market having shutdowns due to semiconductor shortages. And I just want to remind everybody, we don't do automotive. So in terms of our end market impact, there's nothing there. Specifically, what's causing those challenges in automotive is a tightening in semiconductor components, and we are seeing some of that. We don't foresee any issues here in the fiscal second quarter. From an inventory standpoint, we feel pretty comfortable where we're at. We do start to see lead times start to extend, a little pricing pressure here and there, so it's definitely real from our perspective. I feel actually pretty comfortable. Our teams definitely have to work harder through these periods, but at these times is when our teams have outperformed, and so I'm pretty optimistic in terms of what our teams will be able to do. The one part that I get a little nervous on is looking at those forecasts as we go into the back half of the year. If our customers start dropping in big demand, our ability to react and bring things in is really kind of the bigger challenge. And so we have been talking to our customers about inventory levels and what we're comfortable storing. Now, keep in mind, our customers are responsible for the inventory levels. Plexus doesn't speculate. So from our standpoint, it's really just working through with our customers where they need to be. And we do have some customers that have increased raw component inventories to be able to respond to upside demand in the back half of the year. And so, again, it's a mix with each customer, but we do see it coming a bit more But I think we're responding appropriately. And at this point, the teams are handling it really well. I'm at this, Pat. On the balance sheet, I just want to comment for the second quarter. We do expect a slight build in inventory dollars to the tune of about $20 million.

Okay. Thanks for that. And then I did want to follow up on previous questions just regarding your guidance for next quarter and then for the year. As you said, a little bit different than you saw a quarter ago. But when I add the numbers, you know, the revenue, I don't think consensus for fiscal 21 is going to change much. And you're going to be looking at, obviously, tougher comps at the back half when you had a really, really strong last September quarter. But it sounds like the setup for 2022, as Adam indicated, is good. I guess my question is, should we start thinking about a return to that 9% to 11% revenue growth target? And in terms of margins, I know that in the past when you've had some really big ramp-ups quarter to quarter, there's been some costs and some margin headwinds. So how should we think about, you know, growth versus the margin in the mix of the business?",Pat Germain,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, I think maybe I'll start with 22, and then there's a couple other topics I want to hit as well. But, I mean, certainly too early to talk about 22 and give any sort of, guide or color, but I think it's setting up to be a really good year. When you look at the factors and the catalysts that I talked about earlier, I think that's quite good. And I mean, kind of backing up to 21, I mean, I would say, well, it's not 9 to 12. It still sets up to be a pretty good year or a growth year from a revenue standpoint. But the EPS leverage, I mean, you start to do the math on that, it looks pretty good. So I think that's a compelling story for fiscal 21. And, Matt, you mentioned margin headwinds with transitions. We always have those transitions going on, so I wouldn't say that's necessarily impacting margins. We do have the Thailand facility that's going to be ramping up, and it typically takes a few quarters before a new site reaches corporate averages. And then the other item we're watching is travel expenses. They've been obviously very depressed, and we expect some return at some point, but I don't think we'll get back to the levels we were at pre- COVID.

And just last quick question, just regarding costs, Pat, you didn't call out a COVID-related cost. Is that just sort of embedded in your model now, or do you see any changes there?",Pat Germain,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"um so for the first quarter it was around two million dollars so it's starting to taper down we do expect expenses in the the latter quarters probably to the tune of a million to a million and a half um when you look year over year last year fiscal 20 we had about 10 million dollars this year we would think that's about six million dollars so about four million dollars lower there um on another area of cost are healthcare costs internal.

Todd, I just wanted to start on winds and funnel, another healthy quarter here. Maybe you could touch on the composition of the incremental winds from a profitability profile basis. As those layer in, what sort of kind of gross and operating margin profile on that incremental contribution? And then secondly, for Steve, Just kind of on this topic, from an operating standpoint, recognize these wins are healthy. What lanes do the salespeople have to work within, and maybe why not expand those lanes given margins are at record levels, economic return is so far in excess of cost of capital? You talked about passing on a large outsourcing opportunity, so just wanted to ask from an operating standpoint, why not expand the lanes? Thank you.",Todd Kelsey,"President and Chief Executive Officer, Plexus Corp.","Yeah, so from a standpoint of the margin profile of the new wins, I would say they fit nicely within our model. And what we do is we give our sector leaders the leeway to be able to manage their portfolio as a book of business. And, you know, they know that as they bring in certain new business, it'll be at lower margins as it typically is as it ramps up, and particularly with new customers. But then they layer on top of that some better margin business and, in essence ??run a portfolio that meets their targets. So we give them a lot of leeway, but in general, they're good at targeting business that fits the type of financial model that we want to deliver. Yeah, and I'll take the second part. The sector teams have a pretty significant amount of leeway in terms of what they want to do. And for me, a couple examples are, you know, the healthcare team, life sciences team going after robotic surgery, the industrial team going after automation and warehouse automation and the aerospace and defense sector going after space products. And so they're quite free to go chase where they believe the future business is going to go as long as it falls in line with our overall Plexus strategy. On the specific opportunity you talked about, I'm glad you brought it up because to me it really demonstrates the, I'd say, the discipline that the teams have. In this specific example, The customer is switching more from a hardware platform to more of a software platform. That's where their industry is going. And to be honest with you, this one would have probably been a nice revenue pop for the next year or two, but we really saw that that end market was getting a bit ??probably going to be a bit more commoditized, and the volume of products they need is going to go down. And so although we would have chased it, won it, and it would have been margin challenged in the beginning, we also believe that it wasn't necessarily the right thing long-term either. And so It's sometimes always hard to walk away from revenue and an opportunity, but to me it's really the impressive part of what our teams have been able to do to go, quite frankly, chase the right business and the stuff that isn't right for us they walk away from. So I was pretty impressed with their decision. One additional thing I'd add on that as well, Adam, is when we think about our markets and our pricing, we believe that at our financial model our markets support the low double-digit growth target that we have.",positive,0.64,neutral,0.584,positive,0.672,positive,0.917,positive,0.916,positive,0.977,8,0.64,0.0,0.672,0.917,0.916,0.977,3.976,0.0,2.714,3.8369999999999997,6.634,7.414,1,0,0,1,0,0

I guess I had another question just on the component supply situation. During the quarter, you guys actually reduced inventories, even though things were sort of tightening up.

And then I had a follow-up question.",Steve Frisch,"Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Plexus Corp.","Yeah, I would say that some of our customers did get ahead of it. We were definitely building inventory for a few customers, especially in semiconductor capital equipment. And as Pat talked about, the deposits that some of our customers put, they were asking us to get ahead of the financial forecast as they saw it coming. I would say some other industries, specifically like the elective procedures and healthcare life sciences, it's coming back a little bit quicker than what people thought. And so, you know, there is a question about you know, how quickly they should have brought in inventory and working with them. I can tell you that in our aerospace customers, we are having those conversations with some of our aerospace customers now about starting to procure inventory for the eventual return of that market. So it's a case-by-case situation, and we are doing that, and we're working effectively with customers in many cases. Other cases, It's really about a belief in terms of what their forecasts are going to be. So I think we've got a good balance, and we're able to do that.

Just a couple of questions. You highlighted the fact that the industrial wind's was down in the quarter sequentially. And you're also suggesting a recovery in fiscal Q4. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing there. And I guess the broader question I'm having is, do you have any sense if the supply chain issues that we've all been hearing about are beginning to or potentially impacting WINS in this or any other areas of the business, just because it's been so broadly based across different market verticals, what we're seeing in terms of supply chain. And a follow-up on that is I'm wondering if there's any way of quantifying potentially what type of headwind you might be anticipating from component availability in Q4. Thank you.",Steve Frisch,Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,"Sure. Maybe I'll hit the second part first, which was focused on the supply chain impact on WINS. I don't believe that the supply chain right now is impacting the funnel or the wins rate. Really couldn't correlate anything happening there. So I think we're at normal levels. Specifically as it relates to the industrial wins in Q3, I wouldn't read too much into that either. We do not measure the teams by a quarterly number. For us, it doesn't really matter whether we win it at the end of the last day of the quarter or the beginning of the next quarter. And so we don't incentivize the teams to try and close something to meet a quarterly metric. That's why we focus quite heavily on the trailing four quarter wins number. So it was a softer quarter, but like I said, I expect Q4 to come back to a healthy level. So again, I wouldn't read anything too much into that either. In terms of headwinds as we, in terms of the revenue that we're forecast that we have in front of us for Q4, there is a sizable customer forecast that we're unable to achieve in Q4 due to component supply chains. you know, quite frankly, you rolled up the numbers would be in excess of a hundred million dollars with that said, um, even if we could procure a hundred million dollars with the components, then we'd have to start talking about the labor and the manufacturing capacity to be able to do that.

Just a question regarding the margins and you're guiding up sequentially relatively nicely and leverage on that revenue. But it's still you're still talking down from the peak levels of what 5.5 percent operating margin, 10 percent or so. gross margin and relative to the revenue upswing. So are there some still costs related to COVID labor costs in Malaysia, things like overtime? Steve, you talked about the fact that you're able to basically be at full production levels despite the fact that you're still at 80% or lower at labor levels. So are there some costs there that go away at some point and you'll get back to those peak margins?",Pat Germain,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. So, Matt, I'll start on this, and Steve and Pat may want to jump in at some point as well, too. But there's a few different factors that are impacting Q4 margins. And we talked, one, about program ramps, or in particular around the AMS program ramp. And we typically don't spend a lot of time talking about program ramps impacting margin because it's part of what we just build into doing the business. But this is a bit unique in that it's ramping incredibly fast, and we're adding a lot of resources very rapidly. So there is a bit of an impact there. There is the inefficiencies that are occurring yet in our Penang operations that are impacting Q4, and also just some of the intense supply chain efforts that are ongoing right now to secure components. So those are all having an impact on the cost structure. But when we look further out, we do believe the margins we've achieved in the past are achievable in the future. And Pat talked about how we'll be discussing our annual operating plan and our long-range plan with our board next month. We'll come out with a new margin target. It'll be somewhere north of 5% is what I'll say as a precursor to that. Okay. Hey, Matt, one thing I'd add is you had asked about COVID costs. Just to give you some perspective in Q3, we had about 1.6 million in COVID related costs. We expect that to be around 1.3 million in the fourth quarter. Seeing some reduction there as our testing that we're doing of employees will go down as more employees are vaccinated. So we see those costs come down a bit in the fiscal fourth quarter. And I'll add one point because Anya kind of asked about it as well in terms of Panang efficiencies. I think the one thing to keep in mind is although we have 60% or 80% of the workforce on site that are generating, you know, outperforming and generating higher efficiencies, the reality is we're still paying 100% of the employees even if they're not at work. So our cost structure hasn't really changed as it relates to the labor force there. Yeah, and then I just add one last thing on the operating margin target. As Todd said, we're going to talk through that with our board next month, but if we would come up with a goal, say, of mid-5%, really important to keep in mind that that's a gap operating margin, and when you add back stock-based compensation, we'd be north of 6% on an apples-to-apples basis with our peers.",positive,0.556,neutral,0.604,neutral,0.458,positive,0.971,positive,0.916,positive,0.971,5,0.556,0.0,0.0,0.971,0.916,0.971,2.675,0.0,1.915,4.267,4.382,4.848,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay. Thanks for that. And then another question on inventory. I guess the fact that you're able to build as much as you did in the quarter, given the supply constraints. Somewhat surprising, although I guess that's primarily a function of the fact that you had lower production levels because of the Malaysia issue, so you were bringing components in. So I guess the question is, are you seeing areas where things are opening up where you're able to build some inventory, or do you think a lot of this is just kind of tied to backlog that's been building and you're just going to run that through?",Steve Frisch,Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, it's probably more of the latter. We don't necessarily do the component constraint issues starting this off until we get into fiscal or calendar 22 even. So we do expect it to be a continued constrained market. Hence the reason we are bringing in a little bit more inventory. We also have customers that are a little bit leery about losing, even though there may be from a forecast standpoint, we have a little bit of time to bring it in. The lead times are still there. there's more and more customers that are a little bit leery about not having the inventory on hand because they're afraid that it might disappear for some reason. And so we have some customers that are asking us, even though we could potentially get it with any time to bring it in now, and that's where we're working with them on deposits to help offset that.

But what I can say is, well ??We're early in the cycle, and it's a long ways to even the start of F-22, let alone the end of F-22, so things could change. But we wouldn't be talking about double-digit growth unless our forecast comfortably supported that level, is what I would say. And when you think about the dislocated revenue, here's the way I would look at it. I mean, we had, with the way Q3 ended, we had about... 80 million that I would call dislocated because we performed a bit better than we thought we were going to. Some of that, a small amount is recovered in Q4. There's a small amount that's perished, and you can think of about maybe 50 million or so rolling into the first half of F22.",positive,0.495,neutral,0.708,neutral,0.797,positive,0.932,positive,0.884,positive,0.974,9,0.495,0.0,0.0,0.932,0.884,0.974,4.147,0.0,1.915,5.884,7.797000000000001,8.657,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's helpful. Just last one for me to clarify on the near-term margin commentary. So you have the AMS business ramp. I think in the prepared comments you talked more about that being a Q1 impact. It sounds like some of it may spill into Q4 as well. I'm just trying to understand how much cost is associated with that. Maybe a way to think about it is, you know, how to build off of this 5% or so at the midpoint guide for Q4 as we think about Q1. Are there more, you know, headwinds related to the AMS ramp or tailwinds related to Malaysia utilization? Should we be building, you know, higher or lower off that?

To maybe help understand the ramp, if you look at a circuit card that's ramping, you're typically, there's not a lot of labor involved, and it's more about just procuring the components, and we typically have the staff to build more circuit-level assemblies. When you're looking at aftermarket services, it's service and repair services. So it's more about training people to do the service and repair. So the cost that we're talking about doing is we have to add a significant amount of operators and technicians and train them on how to service and repair before we can actually start doing the work.

I had a big picture question just on the new wins and how you're going about it. It looks like there's been a bit of a step up on sort of the average size of the wins over the last couple of years, more like six or seven million per win versus five or six in the prior two years. And I'm just curious how you would sort of describe why that's happened, whether it's been circumstance, sort of, an ability to go after bigger wins and how you think about sort of investing in that front end machine to drive, you know, wins in the future. Do you scale that up more? Do you think you can target higher and higher wins per, you know, average size wins, et cetera? And then I had a follow-up.",Todd Kelsey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so your math on the average wins is correct. We've seen a bit of an uptick over the years into that magnitude and I would say that it is part of a little bit of a conscious effort to focus on bigger opportunities, but we don't necessarily exclude anything from a size standpoint. I know that some of our competitors have had thresholds where they say they will only chase a certain size opportunity. For us, it's more about the partnership with the customer. And I think as our relationships have continued to get stronger, we are seeing bigger opportunities across the board. So I don't expect significant increases in the average size in the coming years, but it doesn't surprise me that they will pick up. Yeah, just to add a bit, too, around investing in our customer-facing team, Steve, that's something that we continue to make pretty significant investments in. We have Of course, we have our new business development team as well as our existing customer team. And the existing customer a bit scales with revenue is the way to think of that. The new business development team we get additional leverage on, but we still continue to invest in there. And one of the things that I'd point out is just the progress that's been made in that team, and that's being reflected in the new logos that we've been talking about. So we've had 17 already this fiscal year A typical year might be 10 to 12 new logos.

How should we think about the overall growth as we navigate through the next 12 months in aerospace and defense?",Todd Kelsey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. The wins this quarter, obviously, yeah, very, very healthy size. And one of the things that I talked about in the script a bit was a large defense customer. It was an abnormally large opportunity that we won for defense size. And so that definitely helped push the number higher. And then as we've talked about, we are continuing to gain share in the commercial space part. And so we see a meaningful growth in that as we look through fiscal 22 with what we've been able to capture and expanding those relationships.

And then on CapEx, you know, a little lighter question. an expected injury queue, but, you know, kind of a big ramp in four queues seem to catch up. So are there any delays in, you know, Thailand facility? I think you've mentioned it's on track for next year. And then on the facility itself, is there even more emphasis on automation? How do we think about kind of contribution margin of that facility? I think you've mentioned the Malaysian facility kind of generates relatively higher margins. I assume given the kind of scale and size of that facility. But how do you expect the Thailand facility margins to kind of shake out? Thank you.",Pat Germain,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. I'll answer the first part. Maybe Pat will jump into the second. In terms of the building, I'm actually generally impressed with the team's ability to keep the project on track. Where it's tracking right now is about a week or two behind what we planned a year ago. And the team's confident they can catch it back up. So from a From an expectation standpoint, we do expect the facility to be online in the fiscal third quarter of 2022. We are talking to a handful of customers right now, and there's some interest in, from a risk mitigation standpoint, to have some of our existing business from Penang move there to help basically build a more robust supply chain for those people. We have hired the GM for the site. He's actually an internal person. We've announced that, and he's building a team. So our plans are going really well. Yeah, and with the margin, Paul, typically, I mean, we'll see three, four quarters where it'll be a drag on margin just because of the business ramping up and putting new business in there. What we've got going for us is similar to the campus environment we have in Penang. We'll be utilizing a lot of the overhead structure we've got in Penang to help support Thailand. So I think Similar to what we saw when we put up our fifth facility in Penang is that the ramp to our corporate operating margin target was fairly quick. Again, like a three to four quarter period. So I don't think you're going to see much of an impact to the overall results because typically we do have facilities ramping at one point or another.

I guess two questions for me. First of all, when we think about all the supply chain pressures, which, like you pointed out, have gotten worse, hopefully some get better, how do you envision sort of business changing for you in how you work with the customers over, say, the next 12 to 18 months if we assume that these things are still an overhang in business? whether it's ports, logistics, et cetera. Can you sort of describe how you do that in a way that helps returns cash flows to normal, et cetera? Thanks.",Todd Kelsey,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, so, Steve, this is Todd. I'll get us started and then pass it over to either Steve or Pat if they want to add anything. But we have a lot of activity going on within the supply chain and on the customer front. in light of the pressures that are there today. And I like to bucket them into three different buckets, one being customer actions, the next being organizational actions, and the third being process improvements or process changes. And from a customer standpoint, we're working to get extended forecasts. Pat had mentioned deposits. We're also looking to get pre-approvals to be able to purchase components at perhaps elevated prices if we find them available in the market. as well as expansion of approved manufacturers lists within the bills and materials of our customers. So a great deal of activity going on on that front. From an organizational standpoint, we've added a number of supply chain leadership positions within the company. We have a group which we call supply chain operations, which takes the lead in a lot of the escalations within our supply chain. We've increased that by 50% with an overall add of about 20% into our supply chain. We've also added key account support for specific customers where we have a significant number of challenges to really try to drive the supply chain through those challenges. And then finally, from a process standpoint, a lot of automation going on from a standpoint of part searches and purchasing and revising our expedite system and even taking an approach which we call a war room situation where we get a team together and they drive with a great deal of intensity supply chain issues. So a number of things going on on all fronts.

They're looking for us to have inventory on hand versus just on order. Given some of the volatility, they want to de-risk the aspect of all of a sudden products disappearing. And so we've been asked by customers, and we have been bringing more inventory on hand than what would be normal. So I think as we go out over time, that will go back into the supply chain. Instead of being on hand, it will be basically on order.

So we are discussing that with customers in terms of how much we're going to carry. And in some cases, they are covering additional fixed costs for us to basically maintain that labor. But we're also being a partner and carrying a little bit extra ourselves.",positive,0.568,neutral,0.665,neutral,0.875,positive,0.475,positive,0.905,positive,0.959,5,0.568,0.0,0.0,0.475,0.905,0.959,2.23,0.0,1.049,2.698,4.442,4.772,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wanted to ask, again, regarding the supply constraint situation, you know, relative to your forward guidance, and I think you're looking at sequential growth in each of the quarters in FY22. So I guess the question is, how much confidence or visibility do you have in securing or procuring those components? in advance of that? And in some of the inventory build that you're seeing now, I mean, is that basically, you know, being set aside for Q2, Q3, et cetera?",Steve Frisch,Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, so I'll start here, Matt, and then maybe pass it along to Steve. But when we look at 22 and what the demand environment is versus the supply environment, I mean, obviously it's two very opposing forces that that we're looking at right now. And I would say it's difficult to answer with certainty how 22 is going to play out. Because when we look at the demand environment, our demand would support well over 20% growth. Now, supply obviously limits the ability to fulfill all that demand. But we're certainly pushing towards double-digit growth. And we believe that's achievable should the supply chain stabilize. and not degrade further from where it's at. But even with the challenge supply chain, we believe that we have sufficient materials being pipelined and sufficient visibility to the demand to drive this sequential improvements in revenue and operating margins throughout the fiscal year. And if I just maybe add on to that, some of the degradation we saw on supply chain was some of the larger semiconductor manufacturers basically doing a reset of their commits. And as they saw the situation continue to get more and more challenging, some of them just took a breath, stepped back, and realigned their commit schedule. And we saw, you know, quite frankly, we saw a few D commits come through that we were expecting on. Now, we anticipate and believe that, you know, with those major suppliers, they've done this once and they've gotten realigned. And so, I think the Our expectation is that the supply commits that we do get will be more stable going forward is part of it as well.",positive,0.543,neutral,0.665,positive,0.616,positive,0.891,positive,0.92,positive,0.97,7,0.543,0.0,0.616,0.891,0.92,0.97,2.7729999999999997,0.0,1.665,3.589,6.13,6.479,0,0,1,1,0,0

And is there any concern that there may be an imbalance of inventory? Certainly some suppliers have been able to add capacity and meet orders where others aren't. So at some point, is there going to be sort of a reshuffling of your inventory, or do you want to just keep that on hand for the future? Sure.",Steve Frisch,Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,"I don't know that we'll see a reshuffle of our inventory. It goes back to when is it going to get utilized. And I think the dynamic you talk about is one that we're seeing. So we do some things in industrial automation where our orders, we're actually starting to procure the materials and it's starting to get line of sight. But the steel associated with going into the warehouse, there's some shortages on steel. And so although we may be able to produce the automation products, our end customer may not be able to actually do the install yet. And so to your point, I think as supply chain things starting to clear out over the next year or so here, we are going to see some things like that happen where other factors may come into play in terms of what's impacting the deliveries and the shipments.
