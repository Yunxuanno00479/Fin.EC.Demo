"Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Nice to see the increase in backlog to 8.5 million today. But I wanted to ask regarding the C-band spectrum, do you think that has, you know, since that has happened, do you think that has maybe accelerated some conversations in regards to investment activity and network coverage and small cell deployment? Yeah, what are your initial thoughts on that?","Yeah, thanks, Amant. So, yeah, I mean, this has been a long time coming to get some additional spectrum out there. And I think, you know, today or yesterday was the day when carriers were actually able to start talking really about their plans. And, you know, Verizon in particular came out pretty aggressively, and obviously they spent a lot of money. They were $43 billion or more of the total spend there. in the C-band auction. I think what it does for them and for everyone is it gives some more usable spectrum, both on traditional tower kind of applications, but also augmenting the millimeter wave and ultra-wideband small cell sites that have been going out there for some time. So what this does for us is it it obviously shows commitment at a serious level of investment that's already been made, and there's strings attached to the spectrum. You have to build. You've got to get network online in a certain period of time. So our expectation is it will take the conversations we've already been having, some of which were already geared around the idea of C-band or a different kind of radio, and just make those more tangible and start to happen more rapidly. We've been... what is it, a year ago today, I guess, the pandemic was declared, and we've seen some pretty different spend than traditional carrier CapEx on the wireless side. A lot of fiber infrastructure has been laid, which is great. That's good backhaul, good solid network utilization by the carriers. That will really help in deployments of small cell and macro sites much more rapidly when that spend becomes tangible, which we think is, you know, in certainly the back half of this year, we expect that to accelerate.",1439.612,1542.691,1,2021,1,0.5,0.5,0,-0.062,-0.062,0,0.6589999999999999,0.6589999999999999,0,0.956,0.956,0,0.914,0.914,0,0.972,0.972,0
"Got it. That's helpful. And then, um, can you talk about some of the conversations you're having for your DAC deployment? Do you have maybe some better visibility, uh, in, in the timing, some of these deployments, um, that, you know, with the wins that you had last quarter, I know you, you had one, uh, customer that's looking to upgrade 5,000 sites. Uh, and then you also mentioned some cross selling opportunities with that customer. So any color on that front would be helpful.","Yeah, sure. So we've started to see some of that already this quarter. I talked about it in my comments. Some of the orders that we've taken even in the last few months, I think that the bigger expectation we have is that still this quarter and into Q3 from new orders being placed, It's not an overnight thing. You've got to test it, make sure that you have the right solution, that it works in network. DAC is one of a couple of different ways you can cool network infrastructure. So I think that the spend around it and the lifespan of some of the existing network equipment that's out there is coming due right around now with some of the big carriers. So we expect the orders to keep moving. We're two or three quarters into some of these conversations, which is the right time frame to start to have decisions made. It's encouraging to see things like a different kind of carrier network on a traditional MSO or cable company, as people would think of it, recognizing the power of DAC as well. So that's an order that came in. The bulk of that's already gone back out. The remaining amount is still going to go out probably this quarter or into next year. So I think we expect there to be a meaningful increase in the coming three to six months of getting those orders placed and getting them turned around and in network.",1570.317,1650.413,2,2021,1,0.434,0.934,0,-0.067,-0.129,0,0.472,1.1309999999999998,0,0.326,1.282,0,0.876,1.79,0,0.961,1.933,0
"Okay, got it. And then your distribution business has been a pretty steady contributor to sales. Can you talk about how should we think about that, the cadence for that business for the rest of the fiscal year?","Yeah, good question. So we don't really have a built-in recurring revenue stream. We're not an as-a-service kind of company. So making tangible hardware pieces of equipment, the real key that we set out to do three-plus years ago was get to some level of recurring revenue stream, and that's what I think distribution provides for us. We have a handful of great distribution partners that are spending a lot of money with us and sharing information Go-to-market strategies and project opportunities and then, you know, joint marketing plans. But the big thing for us is a lot of the similar kinds of products are moving through that channel. So we have stocking distributors all over the country. You know, it's the enablement of someone who needs to go do network marketing. you know, physical work on the network in a given day, they can back a truck up and get the equipment that they need right away. We could also have equipment dropped right on site where they're going to do the work, depending on the customer. So for us, it's a good way to get a baseline of recurring revenue from a consistent product set, whether that's fiber, coaxial, copper, or related components. But keeping those on the shelves with our distributors and having replenishment orders that come in and a certain cadence, whether that's weekly or monthly, depending on the, on the distributor, it really lets us make sure we have the right inventory. We've got the right inventory out there. And we've, you know, we've built that business up from, you know, it was probably certainly prior to the acquisition of C enterprises. You know, most of our, our coax business was that, which was a 10 or $11 million a year business that that business is now doing in the, in the low to mid twenties and, and increasing. So we've, We've built kind of this, call it six or seven million a quarter in distribution business at this point and going up consistently. And I think the thing that stands out to me is it's been in the background. That's not what gets... people to really notice what's going on in our business. The big wins that caused our numbers to swing around wildly were great for us, but I think they masked some of the good kind of grinded out work that was happening in the background of building a channel that could give us that sort of, you know, baseline of recurring revenue as a backstop.",1666.221,1807.519,3,2021,1,0.518,1.452,0,-0.067,-0.196,0,0.5269999999999999,1.658,0,0.906,2.188,0,0.914,2.704,0,0.967,2.9,0
"Yeah, definitely. And then looking into the numbers, SG&A was up about, you know, 200k sequentially, just trying to dig into that a little bit.

"Got it. Okay. Last question from me, and I'll jump back in the queue. But I want you to talk about M&A. I know you're interested. I know your pipeline is growing. do you think we could maybe see an acquisition from RF Industries this fiscal year?","Yeah, so I hope so. That's the plan. I think my intent was to have one done last year, and this one-year anniversary of the pandemic has reminded me that we had a lot of things that had an issue thrown directly in front of them, and that was one of them, was it became really hard to do the kind of due diligence we need to do in a business like ours. You know, it's not a It's not a software business or a consumer business that everyone knows about, so you've got to get out, see the people, see the quality of what's going on, and meet everyone, and that's something that's been tough to do. It's getting easier. I think we feel better about our ability to do that now, and our pipeline of M&A has gotten stronger, so I certainly hope so. The other thing I mentioned in my comments was You know, we added a specific subcommittee to our board led by Mark Holdsworth, our newest board member, focused completely on M&A. That's the whole purpose of doing that, to get faster, better, even more focus and make sure that we're hitting on all cylinders there. So our hope is certainly that we can still do, you know, at least a decent-sized transaction this year.",1877.755,1948.56,6,2021,1,0.511,2.148,0,-0.069,-0.4039999999999998,0,0.638,2.259,0,0.1659999999999999,2.334,0,0.851,4.989,0,0.942,5.679,0
"Okay, I guess maybe if I could squeeze one more in, you know, in terms of capabilities, what do you think you'd be interested in acquiring? Do you think it would be something that you'd want to expand on your direct air cooling offering or your small cell offering? Any color on that front would be helpful.","Yeah, sure. So I think the biggest thing for us is a related but not duplicate product area where we already have success. I think we're looking to add additional product areas that are similar or even things that could slightly overlap, but not just buying another cable assembly production kind of business. isn't really what we're planning to do. Now, if an amazing one were to come across, sure, we're gonna take a look at it, but we'd like to get into additional distribution channels, additional product areas that help us fill out the full bill of materials in a lot of the applications that we're already seeing, and that may take us into some related but parallel market segments. That's really the big push. Passive components, we like passive components. They fit well with what we do overall. And there's a lot of things that go inside an integrated solution like a small cell cabinet that we don't currently have that we're a manufacturer of. So we'd like to potentially fill out more of that bill of materials if possible.",1967.888,2032.922,7,2021,1,0.52,2.668,0,-0.0689999999999999,-0.4729999999999997,0,0.33,2.589,0,0.74,3.074,0,0.912,5.901,0,0.977,6.656,0
"Thank you for taking my question. Rob, I was looking back at press releases, historical press releases for RF Industries, and I noted that June 20th, 2017, there was a press release announcing that you were hired. And at the time, at that date, your stock closed at $1.51. And now it's quadrupled. So I wanted to... to give you kudos for that. I think if the stock price suggests you're doing a good job, I would agree with that.","Well, thanks, Hal. It feels like just yesterday, and it's been really easy.

"Well, yeah, and more to come. So I was quickly taking a look through your queue, and I had a question about the statement of cash flows. I guess this might be for Peter. Your other current assets line was noteworthy, but I noticed that that has to do with taxes and perhaps with PPP. So can you walk us through what's going on with the tax line and the other current assets?","Yeah, so, like you mentioned there, a majority of that is with the PPP loan and the shift from it coming from long term to short term. The other piece of that is just related to taxes that we're dealing with. So, a part of that is there were some, you know, at the end of last year when we filed did our provision there for the Q4, there were some rulings related to how we could treat the PPP and certain deductions we can take that we couldn't take that has subsequently been, rules have changed around that and we can now take a different stance on it. So you hit the nail on the head there related to taxes and PPP there.",2158.638,2202.446,9,2021,1,0.316,3.268,0,-0.067,-0.6039999999999996,0,0.014,3.134,0,0.6000000000000001,3.468,0,0.851,7.272,0,0.925,8.344,0
"Okay, thank you. I really like the addition of Mark Holdsworth, addition to Sherry Cefali, and putting together a subcommittee of the board focused on acquisitions. I think acquisitions can be a really powerful tool to grow a company, but also it's something that's tricky, so it's important to get it right. And so I think you've got a lot of firepower there on the board. So I think that looks really good to me. Can you talk about your guidance regarding revenues for fiscal 21 compared to fiscal 20? It sounds like it's going to be more of the second half of fiscal 21 where revenues ramp up. Of course, we've already had one quarter under our belt, so to speak, which was down year over year. But can you kind of walk us through what you're thinking, maybe quarter by quarter, like second quarter? How will that be? Things will get better and better as the year progresses?","Yeah, sure. So, yeah, I think you just described it the way we look at it is, you know, we think that as is sort of typical in our history is our first quarter is always our toughest for, you know, holiday reasons and less business days and timing. We expect to get better from there. So we are expecting sequential growth as you go throughout the year. The way we see it today, it, you know, would be sequential one, two, three, four, exactly the way it's laid out with growth happening over the course of that time. The other thing I'll note there is I mentioned in my comments, little tiny movements of orders by a day or two can cause the short-term change in a pretty significant way to our results because of the size of our results. I think that's the other piece of this. It's harder to give immediate guidance for us than it is to say, here's what our expectation is for the year. We think we're going to have nice growth over what we did last year. Last year was a bizarre year. We've started this year in kind of the same position. So we think as the recovery gets better and as CapEx starts to flow, we might get a more normalized build season, which anybody who's been in wireless for More than a few of these cycles, there's a normal spring-summer kind of build that you start to see happening. We've been talking about 5G for I don't know how many years. I like the densification play related to 5G, and I think that's going to add some serious steroids to a typical season. We're hitting springtime here, and we're starting to see things get better from a CapEx perspective, but I wouldn't say it's back to any kind of normalcy. We kind of hear that same thing from both our distributors and a lot of our manufacturer partners that we talk to, that everyone's kind of experiencing the same thing. Unless you're in the data center or bulk fiber or broadband radio space, they've all done very, very well in the last year as the shift in topology of the network has For us, we think that the more normalized wireless spend starts to return in the next couple of quarters, which should take our results on kind of a traditional sequential trajectory of growth.",2289.19,2422.719,10,2021,1,0.456,3.724,0,-0.059,-0.6629999999999996,0,0.612,3.746,0,0.902,4.37,0,0.84,8.112,0,0.924,9.268,0
"Okay. In the past, you've given a sales revenue target going out, I forget what, a few years. Can you update that revenue target?","Yeah, so we put a goal out there a few years ago of a combination of organic and inorganic growth taking us from where we had been, which in 2017 was $23 million in sales, with a goal of $100 million over the next few years. We've obviously seen a little bit of a setback in that. We didn't expect to have a year-over-year decline in 2020 over 2019. So that's part of the challenge with that is we took a step back For all the reasons that everyone already knows, we're getting back to organic growth. Part of the M&A strategy is we've been looking for a larger deal for some time that would take us closer to that $100 million number. We still have a significant growth goal out there. The timing of it's become a little muddy, but I'm a growth guy. I don't do very well sitting back and saying, lifestyle, this is great. We're doing fine. I'm as motivated to grow as anybody you're going to find in a company this size. And so we're heavily focused on returning to organic growth, which I think we see a pathway to doing, and that's kind of the way we're guiding this year is getting back to growth and then adding in, you know, an acquisition or two this year and in coming years. I still think for us to get to a meaningful size and have any kind of – more strength, let's say, over a bill of materials in the market, we're going to need to have some scale. And whether $100 million is the right number or not to define scale, it's the next big milestone for us. So we need to get to that number, and then we can look beyond.",2438.687,2535.337,11,2021,1,0.478,4.202,0,-0.07,-0.7329999999999997,0,0.443,4.189,0,0.958,5.328,0,0.895,9.007,0,0.974,10.242,0
"Okay, great. So the addition of Mark Holdsworth, adding to Sherry Cefali on the board, both of whom have... I guess everybody has M&A experience, right? But they both have lots and lots of M&A experience. So the addition of MARC, does that suggest to us a continuing involvement of the previously existing plan or does that suggest, should that suggest to us that the M&A piece of your business you're now planning on it being much larger than the plan had been in the past?","Yeah, good question. So I don't know that the plan is any different than it was. I think this adds some fuel to it from an expertise level and a focus. And really the purpose of forming a subcommittee of the board focused on that is to make sure that we've got the right people in the right seats helping me and helping Peter guide us towards this M&A and when deals present themselves. faster review of the meaningful ones. And when we talk about financing and being creative on how to do certain kinds of deals, I just think having folks like that available to us on our side, that's a big deal. And it's important to note that in the case of Mark Holdsworth, he's a meaningful size shareholder as well. And so having Having that on our board aligns him perfectly with what shareholders would want anyway. I mean, I'm obviously every day of my life spent trying to deliver the best results possible and a return to shareholders, and you talk some about that over the last few years. We've done an okay job of providing an increase. We've hit a tough spot in the last year around the organic results and But the inorganic piece has always been a major focus, and it's nice to have some additional firepower on our board and heavily focused on the right way for us to do M&A. And it's an endorsement from not just the board when we find the right deal, but, again, you have a good alignment with what shareholders would want to see with someone like Mark to help us make sure we're doing the right things and we're staying focused on the right areas.",2583.565,2681.864,12,2021,1,0.529,4.731,0,-0.075,-0.8079999999999996,0,0.498,4.687,0,0.508,5.836,0,0.912,9.919,0,0.972,11.214,0

"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the hybrid fiber orders. Really good to see those starting to flow in. I wanted to ask about the hybrid fiber first. So, what's the expectation for gross margins going forward, maybe in the in the back half of the year and then into next year with some of these hybrid fibers to your tower customers?","Yeah, I think so. Appreciate that, Aman. Thanks for the question. I think there's two things probably in there that are important. One is that the profile of margins on that specific product line won't be drastically different kind of than our blended margins. The way we've been flowing, there is a wild card in there, which is we've got everyone in the world experiencing same kinds of supply chain stuff. We're handling that pretty well, but also the price of copper is something to keep an eye on within that. We don't expect a significant change to our margin profile based on that, but when you add that product line to the rest of our mix, we still expect the same kinds of improving gross margins as we've been As we've been talking about, up into the high 20s, trying to get to 30, and we think with a better mix over the next year plus, some of the higher margin stuff, we can push up into the 30s. But I think the summary is that product line will be different almost cable to cable. There's different lengths. There's different breakouts within them. A longer cable may have a lower gross margin percentage. There's a lot of moving parts in there. But in general, we expect it to be right in line kind of with our overall corporate margins.",967.89,1042.234,1,2021,2,0.443,0.443,0,-0.063,-0.063,0,0.5189999999999999,0.5189999999999999,0,0.922,0.922,0,0.906,0.906,0,0.96,0.96,0
"Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And in terms of inflation, you mentioned copper prices are increasing. Are you able to pass those prices increases on to your customers?","Yeah, so really the place that we see that as an impact is more on the hybrid side than almost anywhere else. I mean, we have copper involved in a whole bunch of different products that we sell. Most of those, it's a smaller amount. The hybrid fiber have a really significant piece of multiple pieces of copper in each one of those cables. And I think our team did a really good job going into this potential piece of business of quoting fair prices and making sure we were taking into account the variability of of how copper was shaking out. Part of the discussion there is making sure we place orders early enough to lock in some real pricing. I don't anticipate that we're going to have to revisit customer conversations necessarily around pricing. I think we've given fair pricing that takes into account the price of copper. Where we need to take increases on some other product lines, we're always reviewing that. That's part of our standard standard operating, uh, practice. I don't think we're going to see significant increases, but, um, we've taken some price increases over the last couple of quarters in, in different pockets of our business as it is to try to, you know, overcome some of those price increases that are cost increases, I should say that we're experiencing.",1055.276,1128.602,2,2021,2,0.4429999999999999,0.8859999999999999,0,-0.076,-0.139,0,0.0749999999999999,0.5939999999999999,0,0.723,1.645,0,0.878,1.784,0,0.956,1.916,0
"Got it. That's helpful. And then, um, good to see that you got another tier one, uh, wireless, uh, customer. Um, what's that sort of expectation, uh, from that customer? Do you expect to receive more orders from that customer maybe later this year or into next year?","Yes, I think that the short answer is I don't know. The slightly longer answer is we certainly, there have not been enough orders placed for that customer to build the network that they're talking about. I mean, our infrastructure would require significantly more of that product type to build out the infrastructure they want to build. And we know we're one of multiple suppliers. We think it's really on us to perform, which we've been doing. And we believe if we keep performing and we're happy that we're receiving these size orders, but our team is very focused on making sure we can get things out the door in the right time frame to make the customer happy. And we're hopeful that that will lead to more future orders. We don't have definitive knowledge of what that might look like, but that's pretty standard. Having been through three or four major build cycles, that's kind of how it goes. You get some orders, you need to perform to have the opportunity to keep getting them, and the better you do, the better chance you have for more upside. So we're hopeful on that, but as soon as we know, obviously we'll let the world know, but at the moment we're fulfilling the ones that we have over the next several months and are hopeful we can get some more.

"Okay. And this last question for me, any updates on DAS deployments? I know your large distribution customer, Tesco, is seeing a bit of a ramp in their DAS backlog. Are you seeing something similar in terms of DAS deployments?","Yeah. So I think, you know, the standard deployment distributed antenna system stuff in normal sized buildings has started to come back here and there. I think the ones that really make a dent in a backlog or have a bigger impact are stadiums and large venues. We have seen a couple of stadiums come back. They were projects that were slated to happen in, I'll call it late spring last year, that obviously stopped during the craziness that we all fought through there. So we're seeing some of those come back. There's a couple of them that have already, some orders have been placed, and we've benefited from some of those in our bookings. The full impact of all the stadiums and large venues coming back, we haven't seen all those yet, but I certainly think we're on the verge, especially as various sports seasons end. The traditional way to build one of those networks is when there's not people in the stadium every day. We're happy to see people showing up in stadiums again. I think we're seeing full stadiums in a lot of locations in multiple sports. But I think as we go into the fall NFL season and then, you know, as baseball wraps up in the fall, also basketball is wrapping up here in the next month or so, I think we expect to see some of those stadium venues come back, which will certainly have an impact on us too.",1245.108,1327.23,4,2021,2,0.481,1.84,0,-0.053,-0.264,0,0.499,1.5269999999999997,0,0.6819999999999999,2.747,0,0.9,3.5860000000000003,0,0.973,3.807,0

I had a question about your acquisitions going forward. Are there certain areas you're looking at? Are you looking to add to existing capabilities? Are you looking for additional capabilities? What are you thinking along those lines?,"I appreciate the question, Hal. I think probably two things to that. Sticking with kind of things that I've stated in the past, we like passive components, so things that help fill out a bill of materials in the project areas and solution areas where we do work today. So opportunities to fill in those gaps, things like power, antennas, cabinets, enclosures, all areas that we benefit from in selling our solutions today, and it may make sense for us to have a little more vertical control over that supply chain. So I think that's one. The other piece is we really like our distribution channels also, and so products that are distribution friendly and can help us gain some more share or some more access into our distribution customers and their customer bases are certainly things that we're looking for. With that said, I'm never going to turn down a good deal on a cable assembly manufacturing scenario, but I feel like we've generally covered... From a cable assembly perspective, we kind of have the complete offer that we need today. There may be a couple of pockets here or there that I would look at, but I think we're showing our organic growth on the cable assembly side, whether it's fiber, copper, coax, investing there to help grow that. That's generally not a place that I'm looking at acquisitions, though I do see a lot in that space, and there may be one that turns our head at some point. But as of today, it's kind of filling in other areas of the solutions.",1412.741,1506.659,6,2021,2,0.552,2.541,0,-0.0569999999999999,-0.3899999999999998,0,0.5359999999999999,2.542,0,0.755,3.278,0,0.864,5.063,0,0.968,5.426,0
"Okay, thanks. What size are you looking at in terms of revenues of acquisitions?","Yeah, so I think we'd like to go larger than what we've done in the past. Doing deals in the $5, $6, $7, $8 million in sales levels, it's hard to find synergies there, number one. And number two, we're sitting on a balance sheet with $15-plus million in cash with more expected in coming quarters. So I think when we look at that, we're focused more in the $20 million to $30 million in sales kind of range. We think that's a realistic size for us and nicely accretive to current sales levels and the improvement we have going on. We've got to get on the market and get some more scale to get out of some of the noise that happens when you're putting up sales numbers like this. It's nice to get back to organic growth, and that's terrific. we'd like to step that up a little bit. And look, if we find something creative and interesting and different that's out there that falls even beyond those guidelines, that's great. I think our opportunity is huge with the balance sheet that we're sitting on right now.",1515.263,1580.666,7,2021,2,0.499,3.04,0,-0.068,-0.4579999999999998,0,0.5930000000000001,3.135,0,0.913,4.191,0,0.894,5.957,0,0.975,6.401,0
"Okay, thanks. Let me ask a question that's maybe a little more difficult, and that is incentive compensation. Can you talk about, sorry, no, that's a board consideration as far as incentive for you two, Rob and Peter. But can you talk about the incentive compensation philosophy and then what, here's an even more difficult question, what it might be prospectively in the future, because you've had some additions to the board?","Sure, I'll take a stab at that as best I can. I think that the, From an incentive comp perspective, I feel like we put together a budget that we think is aligned with what shareholders would want to see, and we are measured against that. There's a mix of revenue expectations, but most of it is on profitability and EBITDA expectations. Peter and I and the rest of the leadership team are tied to the same kinds of expectations that we want to put out from an earnings per share and a profitability perspective for shareholders. It is right in line with that, whether that's cash and or equity. Those things are aligned perfectly with what we think are the right values for our shareholders in returning growth. As far as future looking, I don't think that's going to change. I'm not someone that fights against having goals and then needing to achieve them to once you hit those milestones, you get paid. If you don't, you don't get paid. I mean, that's as simple as that. I'm a recovering sales guy, so I still function very much with a goal-based kind of scenario, and our entire team is built around that, and the entire structure of the incentive comp is built around that.",1617.466,1693.802,8,2021,2,0.48,3.52,0,-0.0739999999999999,-0.5319999999999997,0,0.345,3.4799999999999995,0,0.4650000000000001,4.656000000000001,0,0.84,6.797,0,0.932,7.333,0
"Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time and nice quarter. A couple of questions. First, what's the duration of the $22.8 million in backlog, roughly? And are there any components or anything in the supply chain shortage that holds up that shipment that you're concerned about?","Yeah. Hey, John. Thanks for the questions. Two things. As far as how long that backlog is going to last, I mean, short answer is we don't specifically know. We certainly think it will be drawn against over the next, you know, two to three quarters, probably more like three quarters, so we start to get into the end of the calendar year and maybe even into the beginning of next calendar year. That can change. I think we've seen that in the past with our results, that a customer can draw in and or push out expectation on delivery of those orders, but... Kind of what we see today, we think there's another, you know, call it three-quarters-ish worth of shipment time. Could be a little more, depending on how that goes. The supply chain side of it, the one piece of it we talked a little bit about is copper. You know, we can procure copper. We just got to make sure we control pricing on that and keep it under control, which I think we've done. And then, you know, some of the pre-finishing work on the hybrids in particular is done by outside partners. So making sure that we're placing orders on them for the right volume, quantity, specific styles, staying ahead of that. I think the other team, Long Island has been doing a great job of staying ahead of that and making sure that we're in line where we need to be, getting the orders that we need to. We haven't seen massive supply chain issues, but I think the entire world, especially in materials like this, are seeing delays. So, you know, we're seeing a week here, a week there. Nothing that at this point says we can't meet the timeline of the next, you know, three-ish quarters for the customer to draw against that, though.",1727.457,1825.468,9,2021,2,0.394,3.914,0,-0.0679999999999999,-0.5999999999999995,0,0.1609999999999999,3.641,0,0.6639999999999999,5.32,0,0.843,7.64,0,0.966,8.299,0
"So that backlog, though, primarily is driven by customer demand on timing, not your inability to ship.","That's right. Yeah, and we've been performing very well for this customer and, frankly, for all of our customers. But in this case, for this specific customer, we've been performing very well within the guidelines of what they expect, and we think that's going to continue.",1834.195,1848.706,10,2021,2,0.282,4.196,0,-0.079,-0.6789999999999996,0,0.508,4.149,0,0.0269999999999999,5.347,0,0.838,8.478,0,0.947,9.246,0
"Okay. And kind of with the growing backlog, it would seem to me like you might have – kind of a higher level of ability to guide. And your guidance still seems kind of vague, right? It's directional. Yeah, it's got some year-over-year growth. But can you give us any more specifics, either about how you feel on the next quarter, the shape of the rest of the fiscal year, or why you're uncomfortable doing that? I'll take any of them.","Yeah, sure. So the why I'm uncomfortable part really comes down to timing. We've been burned both in a good and a bad way in the past around saying specific, the next quarter we're going to see X. We had a $20 million quarter in our second quarter of 2018, and that is not at all where we expected it to be when we had the call and gave guidance. It ended up being significantly higher, and then the next quarter after that was lower than expected because we had taken so much that we thought was going to go in that quarter and pulled it forward. We try to give, I think, as much helpful directional guidance as we can. Last year, we did low $40 million in sales. We certainly expect to exceed that, even though we're sitting at $21 million through two quarters. Again, that's very general kinds of things, but we're expecting Q3 sales to ramp from Q2 and Q4 to ramp from Q3, where we get back to some pretty significant year-over-year growth. That, coupled with the idea that how much of this backlog is going to go out the door and kind of what we've established as a base run rate. I mean, last year's results of 43 million, whatever it was, it's not going to be worse than that, right? That was the worst operating environment we've experienced. So you start layering in these growth quarters of another few million bucks in Q3, another few million bucks on top of that in Q4. I have a hard time saying exactly what that number will be, but when we kind of look at it, we're thinking, oh, okay, so what do we do, 13 in Q3 and 15 in Q4? Those are the kinds of ways that we look at the numbers.",1878.476,1975.542,11,2021,2,0.4349999999999999,4.631,0,-0.0709999999999999,-0.7499999999999994,0,0.236,4.385,0,0.963,6.31,0,0.86,9.338,0,0.976,10.222,0
"Okay. And are there a couple of kind of long shot upsides out there that you're shooting for that might come in that you haven't kind of worked into your budget? Like do you have some maybe even not so long shot? Just talk to us about what the upsides and also downside risk potentials, if there's some of those that keep you awake at night.","Sure. Yeah, I think we're coming off some comps that are pretty bad from last year. The numbers got really rough in the middle of the year. So when we look at downside risk, I don't see much. I think more from we get through the rest of this fiscal year, it starts to become how do we grow off to a considerably bigger number Next year, there's not downside risk to that, but it's where are those numbers going to come from. If I look at our pipeline in general and some of the opportunities we have, whether it's DAC or small cell or even some other OEM customers that we're doing some work for, we have, I don't know, a dozen multimillion-dollar opportunities in the pipeline. that have nothing to do with the hybrid fiber that we're already talking about, and we're hopeful that there's more of that as well. So I think the upside is really driven by the big CapEx opportunities around the 5G build-out, whether that's on the macro site with the hybrids, small cell getting some momentum again, and or the DAC cooling solution benefiting from all this additional equipment out there, I think we're just seeing a general return to kind of a normal operating environment, which gives us a tremendous amount of comfort in our opportunity to grow. So we can certainly come in with bigger numbers than what I just laid out. Timing works into that, and if any of these large million-dollar-plus deals come in, that's a big number for us. and can certainly swing us to the upside.",1996.774,2091.447,12,2021,2,0.4659999999999999,5.097,0,-0.066,-0.8159999999999995,0,0.6140000000000001,4.999,0,0.954,7.264,0,0.886,10.224,0,0.968,11.19,0
"Hi, guys. You know, it's glad to be talking about growth again. My question is on gross margin as we, you know, get back to, you know, numbers we haven't seen in a long time, you know, 13, 15 million quarters or even larger as we look into next year. how do we think about gross margin and how much of that is volume dependent versus, you know, structurally just, you know, you're not going to get too high. Can we, you know, if we're hitting upper teens, can we start seeing a 30, you know, a three in front of the gross margin? How should we think about that as we're seeing growth again?","Yeah. Thanks, Aaron. Appreciate that. I think you're looking at it right. I mean, really the two things that move our gross margin is, sales volume once we've fully absorbed labor we can you know lots of good upside coming off that once we've done that and You're seeing even at the 11.1 million dollar in sales. We just did you're kind of seeing where that We start to see a little pick up in gross margins, so you get up into the teens We're going to pick off some some percentage points there the other is mix you know we haven't seen a the full benefit of some of the higher margin product areas that we have, whether that's small cell or DAC, printing through in our numbers just yet. Those are product – we made that acquisition in November of 19, starting to pick up some momentum, and then it came to a grinding halt. So we haven't really experienced in any of our results the potential upside of that higher margin mix of product areas. So we certainly think with higher sales numbers – Yeah, 30% starts to become something we look at, especially when you add the higher margin mix items in there.",2170.571,2238.799,13,2021,2,0.4589999999999999,5.555999999999999,0,-0.069,-0.8849999999999995,0,0.597,5.596,0,0.953,8.217,0,0.92,11.144,0,0.964,12.154,0

"Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit. You kind of hit on gross margins. up quarter of a quarter even after you moved the ERC credit. Could you kind of, at a high level, talk about some of the gross margin differences between some of the product lines and what has to happen to kind of get gross margins back to, say, like 30-plus percent if we think over the next, like, quarter or two? And is something like that achievable?","Yeah. Hey, Josh, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so I think, you know, as a group, we – We look at that 30% margin as something that is not just let's get to that as a goal and get above it, but it's attainable as well. Really what it comes down to for us is product mix can have a meaningful impact. And I think when you look at the large dollar amount that's now shipping into the Tier 1 space, the margin profile of those products are more kind of consistent with our overall blended margins as a company. And the other thing that we generally look at is we have some higher margin items in our offer. The dollar amount, you know, sales-wise impact of those is lower than what we anticipated being to drag the blended margin up. So I think as we start to see things like our DAC offer and our small cell offer increase, Even some of the other product areas that we have that are slightly lower dollar amounts in total, as those start to improve and increase, it has the opportunity to drag our margins up. When we get into a large relationship, it could be the product mix, even within the hybrid fiber that we're shipping, different lengths, different breakouts of number of fibers and number of pieces of copper. Each of those has a different margin profile overall, so it can be even the mix within that product area. can have an impact. But I think our expectation is as we more consistently have higher sales, we think there's room to drive that up from a product mix perspective up to that 30% and above.",828.34,920.688,1,2021,3,0.477,0.477,0,-0.063,-0.063,0,0.484,0.484,0,0.951,0.951,0,0.932,0.932,0,0.974,0.974,0

How should we think about that line item going forward? And I guess what investments have you made? What's pushing that number up?","Yeah, so the number this quarter in particular, you've got some stock comp in there that shouldn't be in there every quarter. So you've got a few hundred thousand dollars of stock comp in there that we had during the quarter, and then also just increased sales and reward comp around the higher sales number, both from a commission perspective but also on an annual accrual perspective. We're performing better, so setting some money aside for that as well. So I think you're not going to see a number as high as this typically, but it's really driven up just by the increased performance of the business and the related accruals and dollars that come with that.

It's hard to nail it down perfectly, but we got a lot of conversations going on. So I'm optimistic that something can still happen this calendar year.

"Appreciate it. I wanted to ask a few questions about kind of the current conditions that you're finding in business that, for example, a big issue these days is supply chains and sourcing. How are you finding issues there, and how are you dealing with that?","Yeah, thanks, Al. That's a big topic, one that we watch very closely. And so far, we've managed it pretty well. I think the team's done a good job of keeping the supply chain rolling. We did, you know, going back to January of 20, I think we saw the future a little bit and tried to pre-buy some things that needed to come in from overseas to make sure we were ahead of that. And we've kind of stayed a step ahead on our purchase levels and And I wouldn't say it's given us a massive increase in inventory, but we're up a little bit partially because we've been buying earlier than we normally would to try to take the craziness out of that supply chain potential challenges. Now, with that said, a huge amount of our supply chain is U.S.-based, where we're buying from other U.S. providers locally. Uh, we've done a good job there as well. Obviously the increase in the hybrid fiber, uh, you've got copper prices, you've got, you know, supply on that, which our team has done a really good job of managing as well. So it's certainly out there. And I think we, you know, day to day, we have to watch it. We we've managed to work through it pretty well so far, but, um, I wouldn't say we're out of the woods. I think this is a, you know, every day and every week we kind of have to decide, is there something we need to stay ahead of?

"Okay, great. Similarly with employees, when you're looking for new employees, are you finding difficulty finding employees, or what is your outlook for that if there are any changes in the future?","Yeah, I think a lot like every other company, there's a lot of wage pressure right now, and it's not just regionalized. It's really everywhere. We want to reward our team. We want to give them the best that we possibly can, especially when we look at our production teams and kind of the related production support folks. Those wage expectations have certainly gone up. If we can find people, which depending on the location, there is some constraints around finding a skilled workforce that we can bring in. When we do find them, they're a little more expensive maybe than they've been historically, which again is fine. It just We want to make sure we're getting good, skilled people and giving them an opportunity to learn and develop and grow into other things.

"Okay, thanks. And lastly... Can you talk about COVID restrictions and how that landscape might be changing? Are you finding you now have access to venues that you didn't have access before so you can go ahead with completing work that previously you weren't able to complete?","On the venue-based project work, it hasn't all come back yet. I think while access to venues is more readily available, the spend related to that and the timing of those large projects, some of the stadiums have come back, not all of them. If we look at the projects that we had on an expected timeframe back in March of 2020, About half of those have come back. Not all of them came back at the exact same dollar level that we were anticipating either. So I think they will. I don't think there's a risk of these things not happening, but I would certainly feel like people are still slow rolling a little bit on some of these deployments to make sure they're able to understand the overall impact of COVID on the landscape and, you know, it's nice to see people back in stadiums. That's a big driver of these kinds of venue buildouts. What we haven't seen are the large office buildings return. That was another major thing where, you know, adding capacity and coverage into large office buildings and kind of related campuses. That hasn't come back just yet where the stadiums and some of the related facilities like that have. So I think they will, but it's certainly not back to the level that it was, you know, pre-pandemic.",1282.8,1360.801,8,2021,3,0.4359999999999999,2.927,0,-0.067,-0.5169999999999998,0,0.467,2.852,0,0.876,3.3200000000000003,0,0.824,6.186999999999999,0,0.972,6.883,0

"Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on the backlog, you know, are you delivering based on customer demand, and that's why you're carrying more, or is it your own limitations based on supply chain? You discussed that a little bit before, but what's really – And what's kind of your target backlog number? Should investors be looking for backlog growth or backlog depletion and over what time frame? Just give us some color on how you see that shaking out.","Sure. Yeah, I appreciate the question. Thanks, John. The primary driver of our backlog being drawn down or the timing of things shipping against it is customer demand when the customer wants something. We haven't really had a major issue with supply chain. I mean, there's some of it, but I think our expectations with our larger customers are we set accurate timelines in the discussions really early on and try to be open and honest about what capacity is going to be there. So it's less about our capacity, though, and availability and more about just hitting customer milestones that matches their build plan. So I think from the size of our backlog, you should expect it to come down from where it was. I mean, keeping it up in the 30s is a is an unlikely place for us to be over the long term. So you should expect it to draw down. But I think the exact number where it sits at the end of a quarter is a weird function of timing. We had never had a backlog north of 20 million. That was back in 2018. And prior to that, it had never been anywhere close to that. So having something up above 30 million says we're going to see it draw down over the course of time. If another round of orders were to come in, it could certainly pop back up in coming quarters. But if we're staying up in the $12 million to $15 million from a backlog perspective, that's a really healthy place to be. You get above that, and that allows us to drive some more I'll say systemic numbers where we can talk about them a little more readily over what the next few quarters look like. You get down 10 or 12 million in backlog, which is what we saw over the last few years, or even a little lower than that. It's way harder to predict because things come and go in there. So I think our hope is that we can keep that number up, obviously, as high as possible, balancing that against customer demand and when they want things done. But if you see a number of 15 million or above, you're going to hear us feel pretty good about that as a place to be.",1404.258,1526.647,10,2021,3,0.4599999999999999,3.463,0,-0.068,-0.6369999999999997,0,0.461,3.358,0,0.898,4.083,0,0.874,7.431999999999999,0,0.972,8.473,0
"Super. And as we look forward over the next 12 months, just in terms of growth drivers, should we be looking for you to sign up another big tier one customer? Is it going to more be on looking for DAC and small cell to drive it with a more diversified customer base? Just give us an idea of what we should be expecting to kind of hear from the company over the over the coming year if you guys are hitting your targets and where you see the growth coming from?","Sure, yes. I think the diverse, a slightly more diverse customer base is what we would expect to show the more meaningful growth. We need to see some other product areas pick up as well with DAC and small cell being big drivers just because they're bigger ticket items. Per site, you're talking $3,000, $5,000 kinds of things. The only other product area that we have like that is our hybrid fiber so that those product areas are ones where you can get into some bigger ticket items per unit and larger purchase orders that go with that. Those are the kinds of things that you'll see us communicate press releases on when there's large dollar amounts where we can predict the timeframe under which those are going to ship and which will help drive some of that. I think the additional piece is we're hopeful that we're performing well enough on the hybrid fiber side that there's more opportunity there, both with our existing customer, and there may be some others as well. Not every carrier builds with a hybrid fiber design as the backbone of their tower design. Those that do are aware of us. I think we're certainly on the right radar and having the right conversations. So we feel like there's opportunity there as well. Those would be the big areas on top of just an increasing core baseline of, you know, We were in the 40-plus million on that base of business. That's coming up as well. So with that increasing and then layering in the multiple product areas that we just talked about from a higher ticket item, that's the stuff you're going to hear from us to put up a bigger number.",1554.071,1642.714,11,2021,3,0.506,3.969,0,-0.0659999999999999,-0.7029999999999996,0,0.596,3.954,0,0.961,5.0440000000000005,0,0.938,8.37,0,0.97,9.443,0
"Great. And last question. You know, the revenue growth is great, great to see, and it's certainly part of the equation, and as is gross margin. But really, you know, as a shareholder, we care most about earnings per share here. And just talk to us about how you guys think about that going forward in terms of whether it's product mix or customers or operating margins or whatever. And then secondarily, that same question with regards to M&A and kind of what your hurdle rate and discipline is on the deals you're looking at in terms of driving accretion.","Sure. Yeah, I appreciate that. So I think from a margin perspective and just an improvement of the overall financials, we agree with you. We love the revenue growth. We know that we see that first for a company of our size trying to come up market and get back to some meaningful growth. Love to see profitable revenue growth. Love to see increases in revenue. Predictability by having a backlog makes it a lot easier to manage some of those expenses that are tougher when you go through a major ramp-up as we've gone through. So most of what goes on in our business happens at the gross profit line. Below that, there's not a ton going on. We talked about a couple things earlier that sort of impacted our SG&A this past quarter. I think that that number is generally stable. It's really getting the product mix better and then executing to fully absorb our labor, which is a big piece that happens above that gross profit line. If we can get that number, every percentage point that comes up, now you're dropping $150,000 or $200,000 more straight through the entire model. We feel good about that. We think there are some opportunities to take some costs out in a few places over the coming couple of quarters. just combining some operations and finding some ways to maybe spend a little better. So we still believe we can get that operating line up there closer to 10% or a little better. As our sales go up, we think that's going to be a big driver of it. And relating that to M&A, We're kind of looking for the same thing. We like higher margin products, and obviously as you look at some of the bigger revenue lines on some of the deals that we're reviewing, the synergies become more readily available as well. So that's another piece. We're not going to rush to buy something because we have to. I recognize we have a great balance sheet and a lot of cash, and I think we could certainly stand to take on some leverage to go do some bigger deals, which we're prepared to do. We also are patient and know generally what we're looking for and want to buy the things that make sense for us. The bigger the deal, now you get into some real synergies. And that's not something we've been able to really benefit from in the couple of deals we've done in the last few years. A smaller deal, there's not a lot of things that you can remove from a redundancy perspective. as we're doing now. So I think that the two big drivers for us are, you know, being patient and looking at good quality businesses. We like higher margin items. We also like companies that, you know, can make money. While we've proven we can turn around businesses that need some help to get moving, I think we're also at a point where you look at some of these bigger deals, we're not willing to take major risks around that either. Let's be diligent and smart and patient to deploy capital in the right way. And, you know, it's proven so far at least that we can make some good things happen from that in a normalized operating environment.",1678.225,1865.705,12,2021,3,0.539,4.508,0,-0.06,-0.7629999999999996,0,0.696,4.65,0,0.932,5.976,0,0.93,9.3,0,0.971,10.414,0

"Yeah, hi, thanks. Josh Nichols from B Reilly here. Good to see the company's strong revenue in the fourth quarter and maintained a pretty strong backlog despite that revenue bump that we saw. You talked a little bit about the expectations for next year at a high level, but could you provide a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about potentially the gross margins? I know 4Q was impacted by some of the large fiber sales, right, that you did. But normally you've been closer to the high 20s or even 30. And how is that expected to change, excluding the micro lab acquisition, as you get more of these small cell and direct air cooling revenue items next year?","Sure. Yeah, thanks, Josh. Good question. So, yeah, I mean, we talked a decent amount about it, how – We were impacted in the fourth quarter. We think some of that hangover is going to carry into fiscal 22, certainly through the first quarter, maybe into the second. It's hard to know because pricing has been moving around. Sorry, costs for us have been moving around so much, and we're not alone. Most companies are experiencing the same thing. the rest of our margins outside of that concentrated business have remained exactly where you'd expect them to be. So they've been strong, they've been fine, in some cases getting better as we've been working on that in certain product areas over the last few years. So it really is a function of delivering on the large hybrid business, which we need to deliver. I mean, that's the bottom line is you get into a piece of business like that for us, we have to be able to deliver on that. And it hit us a little bit from a margin perspective to be able to do that. But I think it's important to note that the rest of our margins held up strong. And the product mix, as we see some of the higher margin integrated systems, DAC, small cell in particular, that we talk a lot about, the momentum that we've been waiting for is actually starting to show up there. That's something that the fourth quarter in those product lines, in those solutions overall, That was the best quarter of the year for those areas, and we see that continuing. We've got some pretty solid expectations for growth in that business going forward as well. So we expect margins are going to be impacted on the hybrid fiber stuff in the short term. We think it's going to normalize as the year goes on, but I think it's important to note that the rest of our product areas continue to have strong margins in line with sort of historicals where we've been in the past, and then the product mix in total should get better as the, as the DAC and small cell stuff starts to take off.",1117.979,1235.434,1,2021,4,0.5,0.5,0,-0.063,-0.063,0,0.5750000000000001,0.5750000000000001,0,0.902,0.902,0,0.891,0.891,0,0.965,0.965,0
"And then just pivoting to the micro lab acquisition here. I mean, it looks like looking at micro lab business, you know, that's a much higher gross margin. I think they did like 45% gross margin in the third quarter. I'd expect that to have a nice tailwind for you guys. Once that acquisition is closed, is that, And could you provide any commentary on what you're seeing in terms of order flow or expectations for that business? Because they're a little bit more small-cell focused, right, which had some headwinds a little bit more recently, I guess, during the pandemic, but it seems like that business could be picking up.","Yeah, so I think from a margin perspective, I mean, they disclose breakout margins in slightly different ways across their business because they have several different business units. their margins are considerably better than our blended margins. So we absolutely expect there to be a positive impact from sales of those products with the higher margins should absolutely drag up our blended margins overall. So we appreciate that and we love that those products have that level of margin and that relevance in big solutions like small sale and distributed antenna systems, which continue, you know, large venues continue to be a major, major place where the Microlab name shows up, that bill of materials for those large builds, we've been continuing to try to get more and more of that bill of materials in one house under our control. And this really gives us another step in that direction. Our products on the coaxial and fiber side plug directly into products like Microlab all the time. So the fit is is good. They experienced the same sort of overall headwinds in the last year and a half, call it, with COVID and all the venues being shut down and the spend shifting in the carrier markets. The same things that I've talked about on the last four or five calls impacted their business, so it wasn't a difficult thing for us to understand. Their trailing 12 months was a tough 12-month time period to look at, but I think the business is you know, expected to get better along with our business as we see the world sort of getting back to, you know, venue builds and other large wireless deployments.",1277.513,1383.716,2,2021,4,0.519,1.019,0,-0.068,-0.131,0,0.6779999999999999,1.253,0,0.942,1.844,0,0.916,1.807,0,0.973,1.938,0
"And then last question for me, clearly some really strong demand, right? You just look at the backlog even after this quarter, north of 30 million, I think that sets up pretty well for fiscal 22. If you could talk about two things real quick is one, I'm just trying to handicap the odds of you guys being able to secure some of these additional large orders like you've been doing recently. I know that's not included in the company's preliminary outlook for next year. Then two, just on the SG&A expense, I know there's some increased costs and things like that. You're around a little bit under $4 million for the quarter. What's the thought process on how that's going to play out over the next several quarters? Is that here to stay? Is that the normalized level, or do you think that there's some potential for that to migrate back down over the following quarters.","Sure. Yeah, I'll tackle the question on orders, and then I'll let Peter talk through the SG&A. So on the orders, as I said in the last few calls, the orders that we have in-house are not enough to complete a full build plan that's been shared with us. and in some cases announced publicly on this carrier's specific build plan, there's going to have to be more orders there. We feel like we've been performing well. I mean, one of the reasons that I made the comment that I did during my comments around we're delivering very well on that business. We're bringing product in. We're getting it built. We're getting it shipped out the door. Yeah, it hit us in the margin a little bit this past quarter. I'm okay with that based on the fact that we continue to perform well. The only way you have a chance of getting more business is if you continue performing well and you lock in some large orders. That's great. That allows us to plan better. You can't plan for the kind of inflationary chaos that we've experienced in some of these product costs and then the logistics is a whole separate conversation. So I think because we've continued to perform well, we feel like we're in a good spot to get more orders if that's the route that they choose to go. So that's the reason why we sort of projected next year without them and said, look, we're expecting decent growth again, getting back to a growth plan, even without any additional orders. Any new orders would be upside to the numbers that we're putting out there. And we feel good about how we're performing. We're hopeful that there's more in there for us. hard to know on timing and exact, you know, size of what orders might look like, but there's definitely more orders that need to be cut in order to get the build plan completed at the levels, you know, short and long-term that's been shared with us. So we're hopeful on that. Peter, do you want to talk about kind of normalized SG&A levels in the coming quarters? Sure, no problem. Hey, Josh. Yeah, so SG&A... As you mentioned there, we're just north of $4 million here for the quarter. That includes the kind of sales and performance-related bonuses that we accrued for and picked up in Q4 based on how we ended the year there. And there was also some one-time charges that we noted of about $105,000, a normalized state kind of going forward. We expect that, obviously, to come down. Some of the items, you know, if you exclude one-time charges that we're seeing going forward, you know, some more additional, you know, acquisition-related charges are expected to come through. And depending on how the purchase price accounting shakes out for the micro lab transaction, you know, amortization will definitely kick up, right? But if you kind of do those one-time charges add back and look at. I think we should be south of $4 million going forward in our SG&A line.",1436.233,1624.83,3,2021,4,0.434,1.453,0,-0.064,-0.195,0,0.623,1.876,0,0.926,2.77,0,0.861,2.668,0,0.952,2.89,0
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter research. Let me start first by saying congratulations on strong revenue growth and good backlog, Rob. And let me start with a distraction which is there is some controversy about 5G and airports and pilots in the US seem to be nervous about that, but it doesn't seem to be an issue outside the US. Can you talk about what's going on there?","Yeah, this is another deep technology kind of conversation that's been out there for some time around health and safety of wireless signals and then other interference potential issues. I think it's I mean, you talk about what frequencies are being deployed on 5G networks, and if those frequencies are also being utilized for critical communications of aircraft, which certainly some of those are, there's fear that there could be an overlap and therefore some issues interfering with the communication from planes. I think it's, you know, technology says, yes, that's possible. However, there are several different frequency blocks that are being utilized to deploy 5G. And I think we're kind of getting caught up in, you know, the overzealous response to, oh my gosh, every plane is going to have a problem communicating. It really is going to be a rare case that the frequencies would be identical. When you look at these large auctions that have happened over the last few years, frequency blocks being acquired by all the carriers, Not every one of those frequency blocks has anything to do with the same communication frequencies used by critical communications of any kind, not just airplanes, but other types of critical communications. The FCC, on purpose, puts out different blocks of frequencies to be utilized for different communication types to avoid there being interference in those kinds of issues. So I get it. At the root, I understand what they're trying to accomplish. There may be certain frequencies that are less desirable to put near airports. Got it. That's something I think we can work around to allow the communications to still work. And I'm not trying to downplay it. It's absolutely planes have to have safe communications. But I think there's technology ways using different frequencies and different ways of deploying the network that should alleviate that concern.",1678.163,1797.733,4,2021,4,0.49,1.943,0,-0.061,-0.256,0,0.32,2.196,0,0.871,3.641,0,0.752,3.42,0,0.968,3.858,0
"Okay. Thank you, Rob. Can you talk about, so you've got this, the shelf that you filed, it's not going to be used for your acquisition that we're just going to close in the first quarter for Microlab. But for Microlab, you're going to be using some bank borrowing. One of the intriguing and really nice things about RF Industries to date is that you've had essentially no debt. But on the other hand, there's a great argument that companies should use a certain amount of debt because their tax advantages of being able to write off interest costs and such. So, with the bank borrowing for Microlab and the potential use of the shelf in the future, if you choose to use it, and right now, of course, if you lock in long-term rates, they're pretty low. Can you talk about your philosophy on debt versus equity?","Sure. Yeah, no problem. Good question. It's a big topic for us right now. I mean, RF industry is two things. We've never had a shelf out there in our history. So it's a prudent thing for us to do. It's smart to have it there. Our intent is not to use that until we feel like we're getting the right value in our stock, which I don't think we are at the moment. The bigger part of what you just asked is you know, cost of capital when you look at debt in the, you know, low single digits from a debt perspective, you compare that to cost of capital in using equity and you're looking at, you know, 10, 12, 15 percent kinds of things. So, it's significantly higher to, from a cost of capital perspective, to use equity. Our intent is not to use equity, you know, For deals like this, we've got decent debt agreements out there that we're working through and we're comfortable that that's the direction that we're going because it is so inexpensive. And I think we can benefit as a company, we can benefit from taking on some debt and really focus on that return on invested capital. I think we're pretty good at deploying capital. If you look at the acquisitions that we've done, prior to this, and even the investments internally, which have been relatively small, but those kinds of investments have allowed us to take our volumes up, especially in our distribution-centric business. So we're very focused on being prudent about deploying capital. As I've said on prior calls, very patient around M&A, looking for the right kinds of businesses, the right kinds of people involved, the right valuation points, And I think all of those things sort of lend themselves to, we're generally going to be the ones that are looking for the least expensive way to do something, deploying capital when it makes sense versus just doing it to do it. You know, I never felt pressured, maybe I should have, but I never felt pressured to get a deal done, even though it took away longer than what we were expecting it to take. And, you know, we're happy to have one now that we hope can get through shareholder approval and, and get on to getting our hands on that business. But, um, you know, the, the punchline here is cost of debt is incredibly low, uh, especially right now when we want to take advantage of that.",1881.141,2022.998,5,2021,4,0.516,2.459,0,-0.066,-0.322,0,0.411,2.607,0,0.891,4.532,0,0.899,4.319,0,0.973,4.831,0
"Right. Okay. Um, can, can you talk about, um, the landscape now as far as, uh, potential acquisitions? Is it, is it, is, are you seeing a, a bunch of interesting opportunities, or is this something that just arises kind of like overnight and you don't have any visibility for opportunities that may come up in the future?","Yeah, I love the ones that show up overnight. I haven't had that in a while. Most of the things that we've been working through have been on an agenda or a list for some time. The micro lab discussion is a good example of that. We've worked through that for several months. with some specific outcomes we were trying to drive there. And thankfully, it looks like we've gotten to those, which is good. But I'm generally not... While I'm very patient in deploying capital and very patient in doing the right deals, I'm not patient about looking for the next one. So... So it's sort of, all right, on to the next one. What else is out there? We have a decent list that continue to work through. New things pop up every week. I think the good news is people now know that we are, you know, we don't just say we're acquisitive. We actually are. We're active. We're vocal about it and say exactly kind of what we're looking for. So order of magnitude, the thing that I'm appreciative of is we're getting to a point where we can do larger deals. This one's not gigantic, but it's the largest deal that RF Industries has ever done. And it's a meaningful step up in a whole bunch of ways to kind of take our revenue up closer towards that $100 million number. And obviously, the accretive impact on the bottom line, we're looking for an immediate effect there as well when we close this deal. So For me, I'd like to continue finding deals of this size or larger. There are a few things out there that are kind of kicking around. I get a lot of deals put in front of me weekly that are, call it six to eight million in sales. Those are the ones that there's got to be an interesting product line or solution set in there or some disruptive relationship. It's just harder because the amount of time and effort that goes into doing M&A and the cost. You know, it's not inexpensive to bring in however many lawyers and different folks that you need to get these deals done. You basically pay the same amount of money almost regardless of, you know, the size of the deal from a revenue perspective. So we are absolutely focused on how do we find the next one, but job one at this point with the team is effectively integrating, you know, getting the deal closed with MicroLab, integrating that business getting that team on board and letting us get our hands on the product lines and their go-to-market, which we feel we can do some good stuff with.",2050.853,2198.372,6,2021,4,0.498,2.957,0,-0.058,-0.38,0,0.602,3.209,0,0.921,5.453,1,0.845,5.164,0,0.958,5.789,0
"Right. Regarding MicroLips, how long do you think that will take to integrate into your business?","Yeah, I don't think the integration will take very long. It's something that we intend to keep working through even while the proxy process is playing out with Wireless Telecom Group. we're communicating with that team all the time and working through the various technical integration pieces. The go-to-market and product pieces, it is a dovetail fit almost perfectly. So I anticipate when we close that deal, right around that time, we'll effectively have integrated that team into a broader organization structure that really lets us get the immediate upside. This one is a mature business. The product lines are something that we know very well. We've been interacting with these products in most of the solutions we sell into for a long time. We know the company well. I know it from my days in distribution in a prior life. My leadership team from a sales and product perspective know it very, very well. So That coupled with the fact they've got some really talented people on the team, I think it's going to make this integration easier than maybe it might seem on the outside. And we're leaving them where they are. They're staying put exactly in the same location. And it's our job to invest in that in a way that allows some growth to happen. But I think the growth is the bigger thing I'm focused on. The integration piece is seemingly going to be a little easier for us.",2207.219,2298.094,7,2021,4,0.527,3.484,0,-0.063,-0.443,0,0.558,3.767,0,0.3819999999999999,5.835,0,0.868,6.032,0,0.973,6.762,0
"Hey, I'm Matt Grove. Good morning, guys. I know it's earlier there and late here, so we're covering the time difference well. Let me go back on a couple of things. Let me start, if I could, on Microlab. I'm just curious, Rob, you mentioned you had been working on it for a number of months. Is this something that was wireless trying to – have they been working in a – And I kept making a conscious effort to exit that business. And it just came about or was this something that you guys approach them on somebody that a light went off and they said it makes sense to accident? Yeah, so","So strategically for them, I can't speak to that other than in their press release last week announcing the deal, they did talk about the heavy focus on the other pieces of their business that are really not related to the micro lab business almost at all. So I think there's a focus piece in there. But from how it came about, these two companies have known each other for a very long time. I mean, we really don't compete. We overlap a tiny little you know, a couple percentage probably on, on sales on both sides. Uh, we go through a lot of the same channels though, and, um, we get compared to each other often. You know, it's, it's very common on calls like this. Um, or when I go to conferences, uh, whenever that's allowed again, uh, people will ask about, uh, you know, micro lab, they ask about a handful of other companies. So it, um, you know, it's not a lack of knowledge. And I think just the conversation sort of organically found its way into, uh, into a good discussion topic with their team and ended up kicking it around for a little while and then working through some of the more process-based things. But it came about organically in a good way. I think it made sense for both companies. I mean, for us, it makes sense perfectly from a bill of materials perspective and a go-to-market perspective. And for them, I think, as their press release said, it allows them to put some real focus on the other pieces of their business.",2362.567,2448.408,8,2021,4,0.4649999999999999,3.949,0,-0.072,-0.515,0,0.293,4.06,0,0.133,5.968,0,0.845,6.877,0,0.974,7.736,0
"If you look at trough tech, we've heard, you know, that's obviously been an area that for the last year or more, you've been excited about the prospects, obviously, aside from the better margin, but just the opportunity. I think you mentioned they had a good fourth quarter. What's happened there that's driving that? I mean, have you seen, is it all related to the, you know, build out the carriers realizing that things are running hotter as they're starting to do things or what's driving that? And what are you seeing on the level of quoting and backlog there?","Yeah, so I can tell you, the quoting and backlog are cranking. We're seeing a ton of opportunities and handling those very well. I think both the DAC thermal cooling and the small cell offer there are getting some notice. The reason for that, they've had a great offering. That's why we did the acquisition earlier. I think the go-to-market that we've decided to use by adding some real focus with some additional sales resources corporately within RF Industries, but largely focused on those solution areas, and then the pull-through that those can have with some of our other product lines. That engagement with the carrier ecosystem and sort of related is starting to show up. That's not a quick sales process. You have to take a very technical product line or product lines and get in front of the right people. They have to put those products through their paces, whether that's in a network, in a lab, in a demo case, or all of those things. And that process in a normal world should take six months. In the world that we've been living in for the last few years, it takes more like 12 months. So we're kind of getting to that inflection point where we've had a lot of long-term conversations going on. Those are starting to show up in in quotes, in bookings, in backlog, and in shipments. And I think just having build plans around small cell, New York's a great example. The small cell network that is being deployed and needs to be deployed there is enormous. But the site counts that we would hear from the carriers over the last few years were coming in lighter than expected or just being delayed. Those are now starting to play out. We can kind of see the normal flow that we would expect in large markets like New York, for example, where we hear some site counts from a carrier, we then get an order, and then we ship against it roughly in the timeframe we're told. So that's sort of what you want to see, that the logjam's breaking loose and those opportunities can start to flow. What we haven't fully realized yet, and this is kind of the commentary that we make on the last few calls, these larger opportunities that have been in the works for some time with large carriers, neutral hosts, integrators. Those are deals that we've seen small orders. Those are usually the tip of the iceberg to, okay, that worked. Now let's go for the larger orders. And that's the upside that we expect. We think they're just going to have better quarters as we go through this year with a backlog that's intact there and the opportunities that we know have already closed or are close to closing. But we see the build plans and we see the kind of quoting activity we have and we feel comfortable that we're hopefully this year has some normalcy to it and we can realize the upside from that.",2479.376,2656.24,9,2021,4,0.555,4.504,0,-0.062,-0.577,0,0.6699999999999999,4.73,0,0.952,6.92,0,0.915,7.792,0,0.976,8.712,0
"When you're talking, just turning to the hybrid stuff for a second, when you look at the backlog now, is it predominantly still the one new carrier? You said it a couple of times, are you starting to see some of the other Now you've worked hard, not only just on that one, but you've had some legacy ones too, and even some new ones. Are you seeing activity with them as well, or where is the macro picture on the hybrid stuff today?","Yeah, the large majority of what's in our backlog is with that one carrier. There are odds and ends of other smaller orders in there from others, but by and large, it's the one large carrier that's in there. That doesn't preclude us from getting business with others. We're in those conversations all the time. Not everyone deploys a hybrid fiber solution for their tower sites. So that's part of it is not every carrier is going to be deploying it. And if they do, they could choose to do it in a small piece of their deployment. So very active. The sales team focused on that, does a great job of getting in front of everyone. We've got history that says we can deliver on this. which puts us in a very small group of companies that can do that. And so I think it's helpful to be in that position. We're hopeful for more opportunities closing around that, but right now what you see in the backlog is largely from that one carrier.",2683.309,2741.092,10,2021,4,0.541,5.045,0,-0.065,-0.642,0,0.512,5.242,0,0.85,7.77,0,0.875,8.667,0,0.951,9.663,0
"And last question on that is when you look at, I think you kind of alluded to this too, is there a mismatch? So when you look at the time from your book and order with them to the time they execute on it, How do you actually hedge that risk on the cost side? So it sounds like, is that what we had a little bit of a mismatch that caused the margins to get impacted there? And what can we do when we look at mitigating that? What can you do there? And are they understanding of the realities today that you guys are facing on that?","Yeah, it's interesting. I think historically we had done a pretty good job and our team on that product line knows the space, is very skilled at handling the supply chain there. The crazy level of cost changes and kind of inflationary pressure, both on materials as well as logistics over the last, call it four or five months, there was no way to predict that. The reason we were getting some of these larger orders, and I talked about this on prior calls, is if you communicate with the customer and say, look, the sooner we get this order, the sooner we can lock up this gigantic amount of copper, for example, that we need to have to go inside a hybrid fiber cable, you've got fiber on half of it and then huge pieces of large gauge copper that are carrying the electrical signal on the other piece of it. That copper is not cheap and hedging copper prices is great and that's something that the team knows how to do around the supply chain and the pre-finishing work that we use for some of our bulk cable with some outside suppliers. the day-to-day or hour-to-hour changes of some of those materials was just impossible to get right. So we chose to service the business and make sure that we were keeping the customer happy versus saying, no, we're going to put major delays on here because we're unwilling to pay for this. I think it's important to note that even with the ding to the margins, if we strip out this concentrated carrier business, the rest of the business held up just fine. You know, we got some, there's some pressure on, on, you know, material costs. Okay. There's some pressure on wages. Okay. But, but we managed through that. We can take price increases on this tier one stuff. You really can't take a price increase. Um, you know, if you want to never do business again with someone, you go back to them, uh, in the middle of a major build and say, Hey, all your models are wrong. Take your prices up, uh, because we're, we're increasing things. Um, so the good and the bad of getting large POs is we're locking in pricing, We managed through it pretty well. And I think even with margins being pressured, it still drops a ton of money through to the bottom line because our SG&A doesn't really move around much on a normalized basis. And our R&D is minimal and CapEx is minimal. So we can still make a lot of money even with margins being pressured. Obviously, I'm all for margins being higher, but I think it's important to note on that business in particular that the short-term chaos was just something that we had our eyes on everything we thought we could and some things moved. So we got caught there and we chose to service the business.",2771.8,2939.901,11,2021,4,0.441,5.486,1,-0.064,-0.706,0,0.213,5.455,0,0.835,8.605,0,0.904,9.571,0,0.979,10.642,1
There are no more questions in queue. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Robert for any closing comments.,"Great. Thank you, Holly. I appreciate it. I'm incredibly proud of our team and would like to thank our employees for their hard work throughout the year. It was another trying year, and the team came through with a record level of sales for the company again, second time over the last few years. So we're back to our growth. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We appreciate all of your support of RF Industries as well. Peter and I look forward to reporting our fiscal 2022 first quarter results in March. Thank you again. Have a great day and happy holidays.",2957.354,2988.085,12,2021,4,0.417,5.9030000000000005,0,-0.064,-0.77,0,0.617,6.072,0,0.1079999999999999,8.713,0,0.829,10.4,0,0.707,11.349,0
