The main driver of the increase now is when we gave the prior guidance, our stock was trading at not even $22, and now we're up closer to $27, $28.

Is that something that you guys look at as a positive as you move into the next six to nine months or so?",George Wilson,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, and I'll answer that in two phases, Ruben. First, in terms of visibility, we don't have great visibility because a lot of our customers' ability to ship windows is dependent not only on the products that we ship, but their ability to get installation labor on their side the homebuilders' labor, as well as their ability to get other components, especially from Asian sources where there's a significant lack of containers. So it's really hard to put an evaluation on what revenue could have been had those all put together. In terms of our ability, I think... we've done a pretty good job of being able to continue to supply what demand. What we think that this does do for long-term, and I kind of mentioned it at the end of my comments, is that it's going to extend the cycle. You're not losing revenue.

Could you put it in context, you know, how, especially on the extrusion side, the price contracts, which I think you guys have to the pipe index, if you could just kind of give us clarity about what those indexes are tied to. and how it's different than the last cycle when you guys didn't have, I think, fixed price contracts, just in terms of what the underlying index is, how much of your business is tied to that, and kind of a lag, if you would, just to explain that a little better.",George Wilson,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So this is just in North America, remember, because in Europe we don't have intractable pathogens.

There still is on the, you know, the window side. But one of the big things, obviously, in extrusions is just having long cycle runs, right, where you don't have to change out the profiles, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me, I'm not an expert in this, but fence posts are really just wrapping around. It's just a four-inch by four-inch run.
