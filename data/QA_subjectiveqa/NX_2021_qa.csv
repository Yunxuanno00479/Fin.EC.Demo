"Good morning. Start with, and really solid results, obviously, start with the 17% jump in revenue for Q1 2021. Just how much of that was pricing reflecting pass-through of raw materials and kind of similar question for the increase in revenue guide for the year?","I'd say as a general statement, most of the increase in revenue was really related to increased demand and volume. Pricing started to play a role towards the end of the quarter and will likely play a role along with the raw material increases going forward through the year, but In Q1, it was mostly volume.",900.261,922.918,2,2021,1,0.253,0.3829999999999999,0,-0.058,-0.0799999999999999,0,0.239,0.318,0,0.462,0.464,0,0.899,1.413,0,0.964,1.879,0

If you said it, can you repeat it, and what are the expectations kind of on a full year basis?","Medical first quarter year over year is 1.6 million higher. What we're forecasting is kind of a a return to what we would call somewhat normalized. So if you take 2019 and average that with 2020, obviously 2020 was a lot lower due to the COVID restrictions.

"Got it. Okay. And George gave a lot of great color just in terms of EU demand, obviously remarkably strong and continues to be. You know, just if you had to rank order those factors that you described in terms of what's driving the underlying growth, is it COVID restrictions, you know, is it interest rates remaining low, the efficiency, the standards, you know, or is it just, you know, a combination of all those, just any more color on what's driving that strong demand would be helpful. Okay.","I think, Daniel, what we're seeing is really a balance between the two of the main items. One, the infrastructure is old, and the need to replace windows from the R&R side continues to be there, and the fact that across all of Europe there are some very strict regulations as to energy efficiency requirements when you replace anything on the home. and our products fit very well into that application, better than most. That is a significant benefit and is unrelated to COVID. The COVID piece, as it relates to the restriction on travel, I do think that that's playing a significant piece and will in the near term because I don't see the travel opening up. So across the board, you're seeing people with the discretionary income with the inability to travel and go places or putting money back into their their homes, and we absolutely are seeing a benefit from that.

"Hey, good morning. Hey, I just wanted to ask a follow-up to that last question about the demand drivers in Europe. You know, you called out kind of improved demand consumer demand for renovation because there's less kind of less spend on travel and economic recovery, increasing vaccination rates. But just try to help me think about the differences between what's driving demand in Europe and what's driving demand in North America, because all those things fit the North American profile as well. Right. So I don't know if you can help us think about, you know, what's a key difference between both geographies.","I think they do. I think the big difference between Europe and North America is that in North America, the new construction activity competes with R&R in terms of installation labor, whereas in the U.K. and Europe, it's much more focused on R&R. So, you know, the European growth model is building into that fact. We tend to be heavier weighted to R&R, so in North America, Any resources that go to new construction, I guess comparatively, that's where you'll see the difference.",1113.023,1149.173,5,2021,1,0.4549999999999999,1.5199999999999998,0,-0.065,-0.2759999999999999,0,0.203,1.142,0,0.3379999999999999,2.484,0,0.827,3.793,0,0.889,4.635,0

Can you maybe try to quantify the benefits of the new assets, how much that benefited the margin versus volume leverage? And also, when do you anniversary those new assets?","In terms of the asset, you know, it's hard to break it down because plant by plant it gets rolled into general operational improvements. There are three or four assets that we put into our rough mills that are showing yield improvements. So, we haven't split that kind of detail out.

"Okay. And I guess just my last one's a little more broad, just, you know, you called out some, some labor constraints in terms of your company, but yeah, I've always thought about labor constraints is also helping your company right on the, from your customer base because I would think increased labor tightness drives additional demand for your type of product. So if you could speak to that and maybe what you're seeing there.","No, you're absolutely correct. The labor constraints are also a driver of increased share and demand for us. So it's a balance that we're trying to fight and create. As I said, it's not a problem unique to Quantix. So it is creating opportunities. But at the same time, we're fighting availability of labor. As they continue to approve extended unemployment benefits, it is difficult to get labor in almost every market that we're in. And it's the same thing. a simple problem to solve, but you are correctly stating that it is an opportunity for us as well. And we're trying to capitalize on that.

How much did labor constraints maybe, did it reduce sales even though demand was higher for you guys in Q1? And if that was the case, what segments or products are the labor constraints impacting you the most?","So I think where you would see the biggest impact for us is really on our labor costs and significant increases in overtime usage. I don't think, in very rare circumstances, has it impacted a reduction in shipments. The area that... currently is most impacted would probably be our cabinet components plants, primarily up in the Minnesota, Wisconsin area is the toughest market right now.",1365.959,1401.567,9,2021,1,0.305,2.7219999999999995,0,-0.071,-0.568,0,0.0139999999999999,1.5049999999999997,0,-0.038,2.646,0,0.824,7.002,0,0.902,7.98,0
"Okay, great. And then maybe I missed this in the prepared remarks, but how much then is our automation investments a focus right now for CapEx? Maybe it, If there are automation investments being stepped up, is that in North America cabinets or other segments? And then maybe if this is a meaningful portion of the CapEx guide.",CapEx... Automation has been a focus for us for multiple years and it will continue to be so. We have active projects in place to try to reduce labor and ease that burden of our labor demand. The problem that we have and everyone will have in CapEx is that most of the equipment suppliers for automation have long lead times because their demand has increased and they're having the same issues. So we're actively working to implement processes that improve our existing process. But I will tell you that all CAPEX projects are being extended in terms of their timing based on lack of supply and equipment across the globe.,1431.356,1478.837,10,2021,1,0.425,3.147,0,-0.066,-0.6339999999999999,0,0.083,1.588,0,0.761,3.407,0,0.917,7.919,0,0.929,8.909,0
"Good morning, everybody. Maybe if we could talk about the, so we've heard ocean freight and just transportation in general, I guess globally has become increasingly an issue. Are you guys finding that, you know, I know this last year you got some benefit from, from some of the cabinet manufacturers looking to do, you know, in source, production, are you guys finding that to be increasingly a trend in this environment, or is there some other offset that might negate that factor?","No, we still see it as that is a tailwind for us. Internationally sourced freight is The ability to find containers and the surcharges being applied to containers is a significant cost to those that heavily rely on importing a product. So that is an opportunity for us. Our challenge will be, as you know, is we do a very good job of trying to source and supply locally. So it's the inner freight between our plants and trying to minimize the freight costs between us and our customers that we're focused on right now. We don't have a huge impact on the cost side of us from international freight. So that piece is an opportunity.

"And then in North American fenestration, obviously a big quarter there and the outlook is very strong. I mean, is there any way to gauge? I think you guys have been, you know, doing well on the top line with some of your initiatives recently. like screens, for example, but is there any way to gauge, you know, what the, I guess, the market's growing versus how fast you guys are expecting to grow? And then, you know, also, I guess, you know, Windows is one of the things that we've heard is the most constrained product in the industry. Is that leading to an increased backlog for you guys in the coming course? In other words, maybe you would have even had stronger results in Q1 had the industry been able to keep up with the demand?","Let me take the first part of that on the us versus market in North America fenestration. So as you know, we track a few different sources. And Ducker is one that we track for window shipments. And I think their latest forecast showed an expectation of about 6% growth this year. Obviously, with the revised guidance that we just provided, that would indicate that we're growing meaningfully above market. I think, to your point, screens is definitely one of the main drivers there. I'll turn it over to George for the other comment. In terms of the backlog with the Windows customers, You know, I think that this, again, Ruben, goes to the pace setter being installation labor versus new build. From what we're hearing from our customers, demand is strong, backlogs are there, and it's really the installation of windows into the opening holes that's the pace setter for the flow through our industry. So I'm not sure... We could have provided any more windows, and I don't think my customers can make any more. It's really being paced on the installer end.",1631.912,1712.276,12,2021,1,0.516,4.117999999999999,0,-0.067,-0.7659999999999999,0,0.497,2.497,0,0.921,4.683999999999999,0,0.847,9.679,0,0.902,10.765,0

I know that you guys, your spacers are efficient and would benefit from any kind of new regulation from the administration.

I mean, we anticipate over everything that we're seeing that, you know, it'll be at some point have a renewed focus. You know, we tend to be behind the Europeans in that realm, and we anticipate it'll be addressed, but it hasn't at this point, and we haven't heard anything on the near-term horizon. Great.

Because it's real success you're having, obviously.","Yeah, I would say the success on the screen side is really working with our customers to show the benefit of outsourcing that process and allowing them to focus on using their labor to manufacture and sell windows. The other thing that it's starting to see, and if you remember, we opened up a new plant at the very end of our fiscal 2020, and so we're gaining some growth on an area that was underserved in prior years.

So it's actually a greater share of that person's screen business is what I'm assuming you're saying to me.","As we said in the past, the screen product line, and if you look on our investor presentation and see our footprint, the screens are, in terms of weight, very light and they can be easily damaged. So The location of a plant is really based upon a freight radius. We know our optimal radius to be able to ship a screen.

I'm hoping you can break down or at least directionally give a little bit more detail in terms of price versus quantity as far as the growth is concerned for each of the three segments.","Yeah, that's a tough one to answer. I don't have the data right here in front of me. Volume is definitely the main driver. Pricing in North America is really – push through via contractual pass-throughs for our major raw materials, as you know. And then in Europe, it's the opposite. We don't have contractual pass-throughs there, so it's all priced that we push through to customers. Give me a little time to gather more detail, and we can talk offline.",1127.207,1158.898,1,2021,2,0.327,0.327,0,-0.075,-0.075,0,0.037,0.037,0,0.2299999999999999,0.2299999999999999,0,0.742,0.742,0,0.757,0.757,0
"Fair enough. Obviously, Europe remains exceptionally strong. You know, is it the lack of housing stock that's sort of causing the boom in R&R and qualitatively any commentary and how would you describe your visibility beyond sort of the next two quarters?","I would say right now the underbuilt housing market is the main driver. You couple that with still some restrictions on travel and the increase in discretionary spending income that people have. That has continued to bode well and I don't think that that's going to subside in the short term. So Those two factors are the main driver, and in terms of visibility, outside of the next two quarters, it is limited, but I would say depending on raw material availability and supply issues, the next two quarters look extremely strong, and we're very confident in what we see over the next two quarters.",1180.073,1224.273,2,2021,2,0.361,0.688,0,-0.0709999999999999,-0.1459999999999999,0,0.6259999999999999,0.6629999999999999,0,0.0559999999999999,0.2859999999999998,0,0.825,1.567,0,0.922,1.679,0
"Got it. And similarly in North America, you know, with backlogs for new homes rising to all-time highs, are you benefiting from people choosing to refurbish instead of purchasing a new home to the extent that you have intel there?","I think what we're seeing is exactly that. You know, the availability of new housing starts. I mean, there's just no builders or lack of builders, and the existing – Existing home inventory is at an all-time low. Homes are turning over extremely quick, so there's no inventory. So people that want to do something are being forced into the R&R market, and we absolutely see that, and our customers are seeing it as well. And I think, just to clarify, I think he meant the challenge of getting labor. Oh, in terms of the labor, it's a challenge across the board for every industry, and that's not letting up. I mean... Every aspect of our supply chain is having a hard time getting labor. Our customers are having a hard time getting labor. It's a challenge for us as well. Now, I will tell you that we are cautiously optimistic that, as I mentioned, some of the changes in some of the state unemployment funding levels appear to be repealing and In certain areas, we're starting to see some signs of maybe some relief, but it's still too early to tell, Dan.",1241.295,1316.912,3,2021,2,0.479,1.167,0,-0.066,-0.2119999999999999,0,0.576,1.239,0,0.708,0.9939999999999998,0,0.815,2.382,0,0.952,2.631,0
"You actually answered my next one as well, so I got two birds with one stone. Lastly, maybe just talk about you added glass to the list, you know, growing list for everybody of supply chain challenges, you know, any incremental color there and, you know, sort of, I assume that that's baked into – are there challenges baked into the guidance, or are you just sort of seeing incremental pressures build? Any color would help.","Sure. So for the glass, it's a relatively new issue, and it's primarily in U.K. and continental Europe. So the glass suppliers, there's two suppliers that have float lines that manufacture the glass that have gone down, and they're on force majeure with – customers on allocation. Now, obviously, we don't buy that, but any of our window and door customers that use glass, it will impact their ability to manufacture. So there's restricted capacity in both the U.K. and Europe for glass. It's mainly a European issue. As it's being relatively new, there's very little of that impact baked into our guidance. What's baked into our guidance is what we're being told now. So the only comment being is if that situation worsens and something else were to happen unexpectedly, that could have an impact. And that is not baked into our guidance.",1350.5,1408.854,4,2021,2,0.3369999999999999,1.504,0,-0.0729999999999999,-0.2849999999999998,0,0.015,1.2539999999999998,0,0.413,1.4069999999999998,0,0.837,3.219,0,0.723,3.354,0
"Hey, good morning. Maybe can you talk to share gain or share shift in any of your segments if it was a contributor to Q2 results or in the guidance?","So as we see, and I won't give you specific numbers, I will give you anecdotally what we see is happening and what has been our selling point in terms of what we bring to the table. As labor continues to be a challenge, in many of our product lines, you know, we have external customers, but some of our customers also are vertically integrated and have the ability to manufacture the same products. As they are looking... to find ways to better increase their output. They're looking at potentially outsourcing non-critical components. And so where we say share gain, in many cases, it's customers deciding to outsource some product. And that's primarily in screens and cabinets is where we'll see the biggest impact of those types of share gains. You can also see that in vinyl, although that's a little more complicated.

"Hey, guys. Okay, sorry, sorry. Quick question, too. if under a scenario of a multi-year, um, strength in the housing market, um, do you foresee a stronger shift, um, kind of beyond the current supply chain challenges to outsourcing that, that would drive results in a pretty strong way over the next, uh, two to three years?","I think what we would see, and we we've stated all along that we we've seen that trend even before COVID, um, You know, as people look to optimize their output, minimize capacity expansion in terms of their footprint, and then also the labor, that trend will continue to challenge.

Even if you wanted to build some excess inventory and finish goods or anything, there's just not enough supply or labor to be able to do that.

"Okay. And then sort of in a related vein, there's been a lot of talk about, you know, maybe that this level of housing starts the 1.5 to 1.6 or even 1.7 is sort of, you know, the best the market can do in terms of materials and labor in an environment where, you know, the starts level is kind of flattish in 2022 or even in your fiscal 22, do you guys think because of your exposure to R&R, because Windows in particular has been such a tight product category that you'd still be able to grow in that kind of setup because you're still, you know, all the backlog that you've talked about and other initiatives that you have and maybe just touch on initiatives you have to grow above and beyond the market, maybe if there's anything else other than screens that you could elaborate on?","Sure. To answer that, I will answer it in two segments. In terms of our growth expectations on a go-forward basis, and we'll obviously try to give further guidance in future meetings on that, we are very confident in the macroeconomic data points that we see that this cycle does have an extended length of time and even if the new construction side of it were to drop, again, the same fundamentals in R&R that you just mentioned. So we're pretty confident in the outlook in the near to midterm and through our strategic planning period. The other things that we're doing in terms of initiatives, you know, we've been so focused, and we talk about it on return on invested capital, is also finding ways to optimize existing assets that we have, and we're pursuing other markets with some adjacency products. For example, if you were to look at either our rubber extrusion in our spacer business, where we're pursuing other markets for extrusions, as well as vinyl extrusion, where the need for capacity in other people that extrude vinyl is very much out there. So we're becoming a supplier to OEMs in different markets. We're just planting those seeds, so the impact of that on today's numbers are not meaningful, but we believe that there's opportunity to grow potentially different markets organically, and we're working very hard on that.",1700.742,1794.865,8,2021,2,0.485,3.164,0,-0.069,-0.5659999999999997,0,0.5329999999999999,2.528,0,0.8059999999999999,2.701,0,0.939,6.795999999999999,0,0.971,7.168,0
"Great. That's very helpful. And last one for me is, this will probably be a question for Scott, you mentioned some whether it's price cost or difficult comps or what have you, reasons why margin expansion might be tough in the back half. As we move out into the next year, I know it's a little bit early, but just for modeling purposes, do you think that we kind of get past those pressures based on what we know today and you can get back into expanding margins as you grow the business?","Yeah, I think there's some confidence that we'll be able to do that specifically in the North American cabinet component segment, where we've been chasing hardwood costs higher. And at some point, as those stabilizers perhaps come down, we should benefit from a margin perspective. So I think you're right.

It was stronger than the – well, it was about the average of the quarter. We're still doing very well in Europe. if you think about it, April and May of last year, we were shut down some in Europe.

"That's right. Yep. Okay. Makes sense. Okay. And maybe can you speak to pricing in Europe? But, you know, I know you don't have contractual press pastors there, but, you know, what's your confidence level there that you can continue to kind of pass through any price in Europe?","You know, the market is so different, and I think the understanding of the OEMs about the cost structure of the products has made it – pricing is never an easy discussion, but when you go with data and transparent and your raw material cost, it's a much more – rational type of discussion with a customer. So I think we're very confident in our ability to continue to get price when needed and with the understanding that when price comes back, you know, we also share at that point too. So, you know, I think we're confident in being able to keep up with inflation and, you know, as long as you show it's not necessarily a margin.",1922.897,1966.278,11,2021,2,0.433,4.248,0,-0.073,-0.7839999999999996,0,0.335,3.692,0,-0.074,2.397,0,0.843,9.293,0,0.906,9.595,0
"Yep. Maybe switching over to the cabinet segment. Can you maybe remind us what the lag is with price increases contractually effective? And when you see that price, is it for hardwood, is it closer to 30 days or 90 days for hardwood?","So the pricing index, the way it works for cabinets, is typically a 90-day lag before it triggers. And there's a certain percentage. So the price has to go up a certain percentage, and then it triggers. And that's usually on a 90-day lag. The part that gets to be an issue is because we're buying from the mills, which tend to have a very short time period for us and everyone else that buys lumber, is you're typically paying in five to ten days. So a net 80-day gap between when you're paying the new price and when you're getting to pass it along to the customer, and then you take into account further escalation of price during that time frame. We're chasing it right now. At some point when that flattens and goes back down, you know, there'll be a benefit to us with the same time periods. But until that happens, we're chasing, and it's pretty significant with the rate of inflation that we see today.",1986.87,2040.118,12,2021,2,0.39,4.638,0,-0.069,-0.8529999999999995,0,0.012,3.704,0,0.924,3.321,0,0.889,10.182,0,0.972,10.567,0
"That makes sense. But since they're contractual, I mean, you know, they're automatically triggered. It's just a matter of the time lag at the moment, the 90-day time lag before they catch up. That is correct. Is that fair? Okay. Yeah. And I guess maybe just my last one here, just sticking with cabinets is, you know, obviously demand is strong. Is there any strategic kind of initiative or components to taking orders, even with, you know, maybe the overtime you might have to pay out? Because the incrementals there you saw this quarter aren't great, right? So I don't know if there's anything strategic to you, maybe taking orders at those incremental margins or, Or is it just pricing catching up, or is it ramping up labor and banking on lower overtime costs once you secure that labor?","I think right now, for us to minimize some of the overtime, and that's the biggest challenge from a margin perspective that's non-index related, we are evaluating capacity expansion and have the potential to add some different capacity in a different region that not only will grow our revenue, but also take pressure off of both interplant freight costs as well as the amount of labor time utilized. And we're working very hard at this point to assess our options on that.

"So, things are coming back. Lots of demand. In fenestration business, you're actually, you know, all these price indexes. I was trying to look back to see which year you guys didn't have those locked in, and it wasn't – Wasn't good, but obviously spacers and screens, I think are doing quite well. I just want to touch on, you know, as we think about next year, um, which is getting closer and closer, you know, there's an earlier question about, can you have margin expansion? Um, Scott, I think he said, you know, probably cabinets, um, is where you would do that. And, you know, you guys kind of have a 2% margin even target, I think if my recollection for that industry. So that's going to be helpful. As I look at next year, the corporate expense, you know, you're calling out the stock comp and stuff. Can you give us what you think, you know, is kind of a normalized corporate expense rate for the company, you know, either annually or, you know, how should we think about that? Realizing 20 was low, 21 is higher because of stock comp. Like what's in your normalized rate as we think about kind of, you know, next year?","Are you talking about SG&A? Yeah, your corporate expense rate. Yeah. Well, for SG&A, just on the income statement, we guided to about $115 million this year. Our guidance was, I think, $100 million to $105 million. The main driver of the increase now is when we gave the prior guidance, our stock was trading at not even $22, and now we're up closer to $27, $28. So that was a big delta there, along with the more normalized medical expenses that we're seeing now. Also, incentives are also combined in there. So, we're obviously having a good year. So, the incentive accruals are higher. So, on a more normalized basis going forward at Target, I mean, I would assume somewhere between 90 and 100 million on an annual basis for SG&A.

"Appreciate that. And then, you know, because you just called out cabinets or responded, I guess, when the question was about margin expansion, It w we're obviously, are there issues or ceilings that you're seeing in, you know, the fenestration business, Europe, you know, North America next year, obviously you talked about glass in Europe and I understand that, but is there something, um, you know, in screens, us spacers, you know, extrusion that we should be aware of. That's kind of like ceiling. I mean, you obviously just had really good margin expansion this year. well, it's not over, but it's implied, I guess. Is there something that would keep this year's margin from not going higher in North America fenestrations structurally that you would want to call out or talk about those different businesses? Because it seems like if demand is there, you should still be getting favorable incrementals as well.","Yeah, I mean, that's definitely a possibility. The transparency in this business, as you know, is pretty limited. We're in an inflationary environment right now. If and when that subsides or trends the other way, I mean, we should benefit from a margin perspective as long as volumes stay up because our operating leverage, as we've demonstrated, is pretty good, and we would expect that to continue. And we think the opportunities for continued volume with the product lines that we have, you know, when you can, as you know, with our spacer business, very high efficient, you know, as we continue to identify ways to improve energy efficiency throughout our whole nation, the U.S. tends to be significantly behind Europe.

"You're right. Understood. And I guess, um, you know, pricing is kind of funny, right? So you got the indexes running through the extrusion stuff and the other businesses, cabinets, you're on this hardwood. Um, so given those lags, I guess it is a reasonable assume you'd your business in total. you know, could grow 20% organic incrementals, except for the fact that when you get price, right, if it covers cost, it's actually, right, margin diluted, which, you know. But is there anything besides that component? Because it seems like your price is, your cost inflation is covered on, let's say, a two-quarter forward basis, right? Your guidance is what it is. But that means we're entering FY22 with your prices covered and volume set to go up, But for that, you cover your price. That's a little margin headwind. Is that really the only thing that causes you guys issues when you think about where next year could go? Because your leverage is low. You're obviously expanding your business, which is great to have capital deployment opportunities. It just seems like it's a pretty constructive base that you're exiting the year at if you've covered your costs.","I think we've been, and by design, we've been very methodical in terms of staying on our roadmap, you know, for the last two to three years. And we've put into place the operational improvements. We've focused on trying to add technology and capacity in certain areas, and we'll continue to do that. I think right now inflation is is the biggest issue that we're, the headwind that we're fighting, and it's the one thing that's the challenge. Without that piece, you know, I think, although we still have opportunities and there's a lot of projects that we're working on, we feel we're positioned fairly well, and we've done a good job of preparing our balance sheet for that point and capitalizing on any opportunity that does come our way. So, you know, the inflation has been a, it's tough for us and everyone else to deal with because it consumes so much energy, but I think, you know, What we've done over the course of the last couple years, I think, has positioned us extremely well, and we're very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us.",2473.568,2540.226,17,2021,2,0.429,6.37,0,-0.062,-1.1879999999999993,0,0.362,5.162,0,0.931,5.944999999999999,0,0.872,14.028,0,0.977,14.691,0

"Thank you, George, Scott. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Morning, Daniel. Maybe talk about you gave some details in terms of key inputs and supply chain constraints. At the margin, are you seeing those abate, about the same, getting worse, and any early indications as far as Hurricane Ida is concerned?","I'll answer this in a couple pieces by product line. In North American fenestration, I think we see the pricing and supply issues continue to remain pretty significant in anything that is chemical related. So anything that derives from any sort of ethylene cracker plant is seeing the continued inflationary pressures. Too early to tell on Hurricane Ida. We know our supply base has not been impacted from a facility standpoint, but still evaluating the whole logistics and the ability to get product shipped through rails, trucks, and ports.

"Excellent. Really helpful. As we look out to fiscal 22, you know, based on price increases you either put in year-to-date or have planned at this time and kind of based on today's pricing, How much of a top-line growth benefit would that translate into next year, just kind of ballpark terms?","You know, we're still evaluating what the 2022 outlook looks like. It becomes a little complicated because our pricing increases are built into a couple. You've got the structural pieces that are built into, you know, selling price. You've also got anything that's surcharge-related. that is really dependent upon where inflation goes. So that revenue number could be impacted negatively if pricing starts to come down. So the revenue number is going to be really hard, and we're not at a point to be able to give you a good forecast at this point. But what we do anticipate is that regardless of what that does, if we start to see some softening in inflation, we do think that that will correspond to improved profitability in 2022. Got it.

"And maybe one more, if I might. Leverage all the way down to almost basically zero and generating more cash than you need. You mentioned M&A. Particularly at these levels, would you look to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of share repurchases as well? I know you bought back some stock in the quarter, but any comments there would be helpful. Thanks. Thanks.","You know, I think our current strategy, as we stated, is we're going to continue to focus short-term on paying down debt and then building cash, because we do think that there could be some potential M&A opportunities. Nothing's imminent, but, you know, we are seeing opportunities, and we positioned our balance sheet very well to be able to look at a lot of things that could be accretive. The great thing about where we're at today is, you know, based on our strategic plan, you know, we don't think we need to do anything, and so we're not rushing to grow. We'll look, as I said, to things that enhance our growth profile and are accretive in terms of margin. If those exist, then we are in a very good position to capitalize. In terms of share buyback, we still do believe that we're undervalued. However, there are challenges with the low float that we have. you know, the impact on us on a share buyback, we just think that that's lower in our priority.

Can you just speak to your maybe ability and confidence to pass through price aside from index pricing, in other words, to offset labor costs?","You know, we've pushed through price to offset the labor costs that we identified. I mean, it's a structural change. I think our customers as well as our suppliers are You know, we're adjusting to the world we live in. It's not going to go backwards. It's a new labor market, and, you know, ultimately consumers will have to dictate, you know, their ability to support that level of labor costs.

"Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess to start, is there any way to quantify how much volume or revenue you guys have lost this year specifically in the North American fenestration business just from challenges in the Windows industry and getting product out the door? In other words, can you talk about the visibility that you have or the runway you have on the demand side? I know Windows has been one of the most backed up building products over the last year. Is that something that you guys look at as a positive as you move into the next six to nine months or so?","Yeah, and I'll answer that in two phases, Ruben. First, in terms of visibility, we don't have great visibility because a lot of our customers' ability to ship windows is dependent not only on the products that we ship, but their ability to get installation labor on their side the homebuilders' labor, as well as their ability to get other components, especially from Asian sources where there's a significant lack of containers. So it's really hard to put an evaluation on what revenue could have been had those all put together. In terms of our ability, I think... we've done a pretty good job of being able to continue to supply what demand. What we think that this does do for long-term, and I kind of mentioned it at the end of my comments, is that it's going to extend the cycle. You're not losing revenue. It's just extending and pushing it out, and that's why we continue to be optimistic for longer than just a short-term view of our markets.",1515.123,1584.577,8,2021,3,0.4579999999999999,2.6499999999999995,0,-0.0669999999999999,-0.5479999999999995,0,0.569,1.838,0,0.0109999999999999,1.5249999999999997,0,0.868,6.389,0,0.955,6.648,0
"Okay, that's great. And then have you guys – maybe this is something where you don't really have visibility into, but curious if you've noticed a major shift in mix of products sold specifically in the fenestration business. I mean, do you guys benefit with your spacers from, you know, higher quality, more, I guess, energy-efficient windows being installed? Are you seeing any meaningful changes in the market there?","No, it's a great question. You know, our space are offering ranges from entry level up to the very high end where, you know, we have a pretty strong portfolio. You know, I think we continue to see strong demand across all the lines. So I think what it does show is that the new construction still remains strong, but so does R&R. and the continuation and the extension of lead times kind of highlights the first question that you asked, and it really is being pushed by our customers and the home builders' abilities to fulfill their demand from the installer side.",1614.684,1652.138,9,2021,3,0.509,3.159,0,-0.068,-0.6159999999999995,0,0.594,2.432,0,0.381,1.906,0,0.899,7.288,0,0.97,7.617999999999999,0
"And then last one for me, the cabinets business, with all the supply chain issues and particularly freight coming in from ocean freight getting out of control recently. I mean, what are your customers saying about the insourcing trend? Do you guys think that that can even pick up more steam? Do you have the capacity to serve even more market share? And then any meaningful change in your pricing power because of what's gone on that you guys might be able to get some catch up as we move into the next year or two?","Our ability to be able to handle more volume is really going to be dictated by the successes of our ability to go get new labor. I think we're well positioned from a machine capacity as the lumber and the hardwood supply starts to open up. So our ability to go out and get labor is which, as I mentioned, within the quarter we made some adjustments, and so we're in an evaluation period to see what we've done moving the needle. Early indication is it's starting to have some success, so I think we're a little too early to answer that question. I think if we're able to get labor, then we by all means can take on more insourcing and assist in that. You know, I think... In terms of our pricing, the market is – I think we have pricing power, but there is a market there in that you can't go to certain levels. And I think we continue to have conversations with our customers around that. We're going to get paid for the fair value and what we do bring to the process. But we also need our customers to be successful. So, you know, we look at these as partnerships and we'll continue to work on it. The third piece to your question, Ruben, is, you know, and I mentioned in Q2, the project continues. We are looking at adding potentially a new cabinet facility. And we're in, you know, some site selection process. So that project continues to go on.

"Great. Thanks, George. If I could sneak one more in, Scott, the price-cost pressure that you've got this year from kind of a steady rising commodity environment, do we need prices to roll over in order for next year to pick up? some margin or if they level off, you guys will still have a tailwind because you won't have that, you know, I guess headwind that you had in this fiscal year.","Yeah, the issue really this year has been we keep chasing price. So even as those indexes trigger, we continue to chase. So we're behind the eight ball there. So as raw material prices at least stabilize, that'll help. But what's really going to help is when raw material prices start going the other way, and it's anybody's guess as to when that will happen.

"Hey, good morning, guys. Wanted to follow up on the capacity and labor utilization topic to make sure I understand your previous commentary, George. Was it the ability to take on more volume? Is that in all segments, or were you talking just the cabinet segment? And I guess to connect the dots, does CapEx need to increase from this $30 million-ish level for you to be able to take on more volumes over the next year or so?","So the first part of your question, my answer was generally directed towards cabinets. Our ability to take on additional revenue in the North American fenestration segment Screens, it would be partly labor and going after a new geographic segment of the country that's not served. But for the most part, the North American fenestration growth would be dictated on our ability to get raw materials. Cabinets is going to be more labor-driven. As it relates to your CapEx question, early insight is we anticipate 2022 might have a higher level of CapEx for growth initiatives.

"Okay, great. And then on the inventory investment you've made, that makes sense so far. I guess, how do you think about incremental investment in inventory from here? Do you think, you know, inventory will take up more capital early on in 2023 or 2022, or will that investment moderate as you move forward?","I would anticipate probably a growth in inventory. You know, listen, right now, if we can get raw materials, we're going to get them. That's kind of the mode we're in right now. Us and probably every other business, if there are critical components, you buy what you can get. So, you know, Ultimately, what we want to get to is to a point where we can start building some levels of finished goods to improve our fill rates and start getting the backlog down.

"Okay, great. And lastly, just to maybe make sure I understand something, this elevated backlog you have, it seems to be common thread in all the building products and construction world. For you, this backlog burned off to more normalized backlogs. Do you expect that to happen in the next couple of quarters, or do you really not have as much visibility into that as you would like?","I wish I had better visibility. I think over the course of the last year and a half, that's the one thing that has changed is the level of visibility through all of our customer chains. I anticipate that it's going to take a solid 12 to 18 months for the whole industry to start bleeding that down. It is a large... a large backlog that's being driven by multiple things. You've got the labor challenges. You've got raw material. You've got freight issues. So there's not one silver bullet that if this clears up. So I think it's going to be a 12 to 18 month.

"George, Scott, good morning. Morning, Ken. So I want to touch on a couple issues here. And it kind of goes, George, Scott, if you could give it in context, perhaps the past so we can see how Quantix is different. When we're talking about extrusion, I'm surprised. stretching, I think it was 2012, 13, when you guys, when pricing really costs left out on you guys and you didn't have these contracts in place. But, you know, you probably remember it a little better than I do. Could you put it in context, you know, how, especially on the extrusion side, the price contracts, which I think you guys have to the pipe index, if you could just kind of give us clarity about what those indexes are tied to. and how it's different than the last cycle when you guys didn't have, I think, fixed price contracts, just in terms of what the underlying index is, how much of your business is tied to that, and kind of a lag, if you would, just to explain that a little better.","So this is just in North America, remember, because in Europe we don't have intractable pathogens. So on the vinyl extrusion business, the indexes are really based on CDI. And that's purely the mechanism to determine the index pricing. And then depending on the customer, there's a level that's shared. So in most cases, like 80% of that increase or drop is pushed back to the customer, and then we absorb a certain piece of it. Each contract's a little different, but that generally gives you the feel. As it relates around your question to 2012, I just don't have the detail in front of me, Ken.

And you talked about that being about 400 basis points or 360 basis points of cost that you still expect to recover that you've incurred and you expect to recover. Is that accurate when you gave that figure?","That is correct. So yeah, so that would be you know, it's just the timing of the index.

"Last question, kind of taking a step back, because it seems like you're kind of You have a good problem with your leverage. As you noted earlier, if you buy back stock, you're thinning out what's already a thin float. You're doing organic investments. You've talked about some of that stuff in Europe. You're talking about a cabinet facility right now. This is a bigger question, but could you talk about how you're thinking about deploying capital relative to your cost of capital and the return on that? You know, it's been about five years since you've owned the company. The margins, you know, you're improving, but it's not, I don't know, it doesn't appear that it would be hitting your returns on capital. So how are you guys making those decisions to keep investing money there as opposed to something else with that business?","Yeah, no, it's a very fair question. I think we look at it holistically. And what I would say without getting into any level of granularity here, Ken, is if you look at our return on invested capital over the last four or five years, You know, we've obviously made it a priority in terms of improving that metric and how we choose to invest all of our incremental cash. And, you know, over the last couple of years, you know, our return on invested capital has grown to a level that it's meaningfully above now our working average cost of capital. So without getting into the details of what we do by each segment, I think in general philosophy, I think that the track record has shown that we've executed on that.

It is a very difficult question. And for the reason that what we're seeing in our order pattern right now, in our current orders, is demand remains extremely strong across all product lines. But in some areas, we actually have our customers deciding to pull back on their schedules to give their workforce some breaks in as many hours as they're working.

In terms of our competition, you know, I think a lot of it is based on your size and scale. And, you know, we're unique in the space that we serve that we're larger. So I think we're doing equal to or better than any of our competitors in acquiring raw materials that we purchase.

"Okay. And then a couple questions on capacity. So two sides of the question here. The first is, do you have any plans for increases in areas where you're either low or looking to expand like the screens operation or cabinets? And then on the flip side, Any updates on maybe the areas where you are underutilizing your assets and you guys have been working on trying to offer other products or services? Any progress there that you can talk about?","So on your first question in terms of capacity expansion, I think we continue to go forward. We talked about adding some mixing and blending capacity in the UK for our vinyl extrusion business. That will continue, and that project's In process, again, as Scott mentioned, the timing of such is impacted because of just lead times to get equipment. It's extended, but we're looking to add capacity there. We continue to evaluate the screen markets in areas where we're underserved. We will look to expand our geographical footprint, but that's also going to be predicated on not getting – being able to get enough raw materials to be able to support it. We also have a project in our spacer business in Germany that we're adding additional capacity for our rubber extrusion for those spacers in Germany, and that continues. So in certain pockets, we are going forward and investing and spending in the business. The second piece of your question... on any parts of our business that we have a lot of spare capacity. Yeah, the best example of that, and it has been a win, is on our vinyl extrusion business in North America. We talked a lot about focusing on return on net assets, return on invested capital. We continue to expand our capabilities in producing products like parts primarily in fence posts and vinyl fencing components, and I think we've proven that we're a very reliable supplier in supporting that industry, and that continues.

I don't want to come out and give targets or guidance this time on the size. We're relatively new into this space. I can add a little bit there. I think the main difference between the fencing sector of the industry versus the window profile sector of the industry for vinyl extrusion is that the fencing sector is bumping up against capacity. So they're looking to add capacity where that's where we can come in and help, whereas on the Windows side, there's a lot of spare capacity. So it's just about getting our assets up and running.

In the products that we have in Europe, the supply chain is very similar. although the logistics piece of it is a little more complicated in Europe. So we utilize, for our spacer business in Europe and in North America, the exact same supply base. So they'll face the same challenges as it relates to demand and pricing. We've seen anything that's being shipped internationally has added some additional stress, as you can imagine, with trying to get containers that are shipped or or anything that's put on a boat. You know, I'm not going to rehash that story. Everyone's seen it. That's the biggest difference between what we see. Luckily, in Europe, you know, our largest silicone supplier is located in continental Europe, so that has added some stability.

"Okay, so similar challenges. whether you're in Europe or the U.S. Okay. Yes. And I guess, you know, piggybacking on an earlier question, you talked about your supply chain issues relative to your competition, but how about relative to customers? Just given your business model, your customers are oftentimes your competitor as well. So, you know, are you seeing greater or less supply chain challenges than your customers? Yes.","For us, what it's done is we have such sticky relationships and long relationships with these guys, we've actually kind of partnered up with the majority of them to try to either parlay our buying power together. So it's become more collaborative rather than adversarial in both trying to find ways to help each other and alleviate the supply chain issues that we have across the board. So I think it's forced us to communicate more clearly on, The labor piece of it is still preventing people from insourcing. That environment is still true. So although we're talking about supply chain challenges, in many cases there's still, although I think we've done a very good job of addressing the labor markets, it's still competitive, which prohibits their ability to insource to the extent where it would be a risk.",1861.105,1915.399,14,2021,4,0.491,4.601,0,-0.071,-0.9789999999999992,0,0.179,2.362,0,0.359,4.783,0,0.841,11.155,0,0.97,12.497,0

"So, not your average quarter. The earlier question about fence posts and like products wasn't really where I was going to go, but... You know, your extrusion plants had real issues in the past. There was capacity. There still is on the, you know, the window side. But one of the big things, obviously, in extrusions is just having long cycle runs, right, where you don't have to change out the profiles, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me, I'm not an expert in this, but fence posts are really just wrapping around. It's just a four-inch by four-inch run. So you... not only have the growth potential of, you know, your fixed asset, but it seems to me that it's essentially the same run constantly because it's a white, gray, or black fence post where you don't have to change out profiles. Is that correct?","I would say generally you're absolutely right. The window profiles that we do are very complex, and each customer has something different. So the level of complexity on that extrusion is pretty significant. The fence posts, although not identical, are fairly close. And yes, they tend to be much longer runs with recycled material and are more favorable to what you would think on a continuous extrusion process. So if I were to ask the guys in the plant, they would love loading up on fence posts, yes. And just a point of clarification, George was referring to our vinyl business here in North America.

They just have these long runs, but they have the very tight distribution network. Are there unique distribution challenges you face there versus the window manufacturer? I mean, IE, is there a lot more SG&A? Is it very expensive to start building that relationship even though you get good gross margins?

That's the least impacted by freight availability.",2294.758,2309.815,23,2021,4,0.291,6.922,0,-0.076,-1.591999999999999,0,-0.009,2.661,0,-0.0249999999999999,6.771,0,0.882,17.486,0,0.965,19.966,0
"Right, so this is really about the extrusion part, or is this both the edgers and the extrusion that we're seeing this transportation issue arise?","Primarily, yeah, it's definitely more weighted towards spacers and vinyl extrusions.

"Well, yeah, yeah. So cost neutrality, if you think about, you know, the pricing on the lag, so you get $10 of inflation, you recover $10 of inflation. Is that generally like, what, a six-month lag due to the cost indexes? Is that how it kind of works for you guys? If there was a number, is it three months, six months?","It's usually 60 to 90 days are typically the range we see. I don't think we have any indexes that are six months in length, but 60 to 90 days is pretty standard. Longest lag is in the cabinet business.",2356.301,2370.971,25,2021,4,0.211,7.281999999999999,0,-0.075,-1.726999999999999,0,-0.014,2.629,0,0.3379999999999999,7.231,0,0.7819999999999999,18.898,0,0.973,21.273,0
"Yeah. Okay. And I really appreciate you guys answering these questions. It seems like you guys are running the business well, and I don't want to be, you know, improving. So do you have, if you have these costs, right, dollar cost recoveries on the indexes you just described. How do you think about that in terms of having margin neutrality just to catch up for the math, right, of the ratio changes? Is that something you guys have in mind? I mean, I get the cost part, but, you know, obviously we look at margins a lot. How should we think about that, perhaps?","I mean, that's a difficult question to ask. I mean, when we look at how the pricing has impacted us, raw material pricing specifically, over the last six to nine months. What we've found is that even when we think we're going to catch up with the rate of inflation and where it's been heading, there have been times when we didn't catch up enough. So we're at a point in time where we need to try to be more proactive and forward-looking and try to at least become margin-neutral.",2407.093,2438.192,26,2021,4,0.3359999999999999,7.617999999999999,0,-0.068,-1.7949999999999988,0,0.0549999999999999,2.684,1,0.3389999999999999,7.569999999999999,0,0.7939999999999999,19.692,0,0.945,22.218,0
"Right, which your guidance seems to suggest for – I mean, not guidance. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but your comment that margins will be up suggests that's where your confidence lies for FY22.","Yeah, I mean, I think for margins to be up like we think, we expect at some point, probably more towards the second half of the year, that the inflationary environment will at least somewhat stabilize so we can catch up. Yeah, the rate of inflation – or the slope of the inflation line will flatten or decrease to such a point that we'll be able to catch up on some of the indices.",2451.634,2481.161,27,2021,4,0.233,7.850999999999999,0,-0.063,-1.8579999999999988,0,0.35,3.034,0,0.3169999999999999,7.887,0,0.836,20.528,0,0.967,23.185,0
I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to George Wilson for closing remarks.,"I'd like to thank everyone for joining today, and we look forward to providing an update on our next earnings call.
