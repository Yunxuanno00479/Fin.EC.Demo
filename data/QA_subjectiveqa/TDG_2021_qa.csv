"Hi. Nick, early in the downturn, you – you know, you frame the business with limited, you know, very limited visibility into the end market and top line. You framed the business in terms of how you were planning from the cost side. So you, you know, you spoke to what you assumed for each end market to therefore plan costs. And so I was wondering if, you know, at this point in lieu of official guidance and given the still limited visibility, is it possible to speak to how you're planning the cost side vis-a-vis the pace of end market recovery on the aerospace side?","I think, Noah, because we don't want to give guidance, I don't want to end up giving it piece by piece by the markets. But I think for the cost, essentially, what we expect here is that we basically will hold our costs tight and about flat. You know, now that's going to move one way or the other if we're, you know, if we're wrong on the volume. I'd be hopeful that we are and it gets better rather than worse and we go in the other direction. But I think that's about as much as I want to say.

"Yeah, yeah, and I, you know, I wasn't sure if you'd answer that question or not, but you had taken a shot at it on the way down and it proved reasonably accurate, so... I thought I would check. The sequential increase in bookings in the aftermarket, can you quantify how much that picked up?","It was like 76%, and the OEM was up 88%.

Could you maybe fill in the blanks on what the EBITDA percent margin range might look like? Is 44% at the midpoint, the low end, or the high end of that performance metric?","Yeah, I don't think we want to go into too many specifics on the margin target. Obviously, you know, the 44% is what we gave you all, so it's what we feel pretty good about for the year, and that's what we're, as you've been through the proxy details, it sounds like, Miles, you know that's what we're comped against here for this year, given the challenging industry circumstances.

Maybe something you guys have done in the past for maybe new priorities for your airline customers around the world.

We've talked about some of these in the past, but, you know, materials, antiviral materials are important for flooring, seat surrounds, and the like. We also have a host of touch-free options for bathrooms and overhead bins, as well as antiviral webbing for our seatbelts. So there's some real interest and activity. We'll see if any of it's booked into orders.

I do not have granularity of orders to be able to say, you know, are we seeing more wide body work or not? Um, it's true to get back to, uh, prior COVID prior to COVID, uh, levels, we will need a strong international, uh, you know, performance. Uh, that is an important part of RPMs and, um, and activity on the wide body side. But I've been very encouraged by the rate of activity that we have today on what is really just a narrow body market today. And we've performed very well in that.

"Hey, good morning. In terms of the booking strength, especially as it comes through sequentially here and focusing on the aftermarket, Nick or Kevin, do you have any sense when that will translate into into some spike in sales. I know you've said you don't have enough here to guide, but between your conversations with your customers and the bookings, is there any sense of which quarter we're going to see an improvement in sales that's notable aftermarket?","Yeah, I think that we've seen strong sequential improvement in aftermarket bookings. We've also seen some in OEM bookings. I think what we need to see is more flight activity. That will give us a breakout quarter. I think we're just starting to see ourselves come out of this. I'll remind you that our thoughts when we went into this year were somewhat flat, Q1 and Q2, with a slight uptick in the second half, nothing dramatic. I still think we're on that pace. But for a real breakout, which I think is what you're driving, and when do these orders come through, it's going to take more flight activity, I think. We're just at the beginning of the takeoff, I think, and we need more positive signs of that. That lends itself to Mike's answer for the last question as well. We just need to see more stability here, more consistent performance for us to feel comfortable with the future quarters. We know that we book up to two years out on OEM, and so it's harder to predict when OEM orders will come in. Aftermarket orders tend to be more book and ship.

We are very disciplined in adding back costs. We will do so in a very disciplined manner. We will pass along, of course, increased costs in terms of inflationary pressures. We will practice the same playbook as always as we go through this. I think this will work very well for trans time.

But now as we start thinking about recovery and when we get to a point where assets could trade on EBITDA numbers that feel a little bit firmer, would you – Would you guess that 2023 is one of those sort of, you know, recovered years where, you know, you begin to close, you know, the bid-ask spreads because people have a bit more conviction in the EBITDA, or is that still too early?

I think we're really bullish about the order book on the defense side. We always see lumpiness, and I've talked about it in the past, APKWS parachute orders on lumpiness on OEM. Sometimes those orders ship. Sometimes the bookings are delayed. We've seen strength in aftermarket, recent bookings in aftermarket, defense aftermarket have been strong.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kayoglu of Jefferies. Your line is open.,"Yeah, we have seen solid growth in defense this year. It is obviously an important segment. We continue to look for opportunities to prune that, as you've just heard, and we're happy with our defense portfolio today. As I look forward, I think continued modest growth will be the future. I think there's enough geopolitical unrest in the world that will continue this. We are also not involved in the sort of the boots on the ground part of defense. So we're on the technology, the unmanned, we're in space. I think we're on the right side of defense business to continue to grow. As I looked at our growth for the quarter, I couldn't really point to one program that was leading the day. It's nice growth across the board. Our parachutes business has been doing well. You know, the F-35 business has continued to do well for us, but it's really across the board. I would expect this to be lumpy. I would expect there to be fits and starts. I don't think you're going to have, you know, a seamless, perfect growth out of this. But I still expect things to be moving in the improving direction.

About $100 million went back into accounts receivable. We knew that was going to happen. As a reminder, from peak to trough, about $400 million came out of accounts receivable during COVID. So that's going to have to go in as we go back in, as we go through the rebound here. It did tick up this year over the past couple quarters. As you know, this last quarter was $100 million. That's going to continue. Ultimately, how much goes back into AR and the pace at which that happens depends on the pace of the recovery, but we do expect it to be a use of cash on the order of at least $100 million during our FY22, potentially more. That would be a good problem to have, by the way. I mean, if the commercial markets rebound and we have to invest more in AR, we're happy to do that. We certainly have the cash. And then, sorry, Noah, your second question was on CapEx, I think. We put out a range of 135 to 155 today. It is slightly higher on a percentage basis. It's tied to some one-time projects at some of our op units. As you know, our first use of cash is to go and deploy it into our own businesses to help them grow, and we're just doing some of that with some large one-time projects at select op units.",1466.427,1545.439,3,2021,4,0.424,0.95,0,-0.0629999999999999,-0.1849999999999999,0,0.129,0.538,0,0.964,1.118,0,0.834,2.188,0,0.7989999999999999,2.366,0

"And just a quick follow-up on that, maybe. As you look at how this could pan out in 2022, have you built some sort of contingency for these issues into that EBITDA margin guidance?","I don't think we have, but this is part of the I guess, conservatism. So we try to be conservative as we forecast going forward. We haven't specifically allotted anything to supply chain disruption, but I think it is part of our belief that this could be an issue for us as we go forward. As George mentioned, specifically on electronic components and those types of parts, we're seeing some supply difficulties. You know, in terms of inflationary pressures, I think we'd all agree that we will look to pass those along, as we always have.

So, I mean, not to beat a dead horse here, but it sounds like there's a healthy amount of conservatism in the 47% unless you want to.","Well, on the margin guide, remember we also bought Cobham too, which kind of counteracts the divestitures the other way and cancels it out.

"Okay, perfect. And then within the aftermarket growth rate range, the 20 to 30 percent, Kevin, is there a figure of merit that you're using to ballpark that? Is that a sequential growth that's underlying? Is that a traffic growth?","Well, I think it's traffic growth related. And I think we're counting on that largely being, you know, U.S., Europe related. We'll have to see how it unpacks around the globe. As you guys all know, we don't have geographical information yet. along those lines. But, you know, we will continue to monitor this closely. If the traffic patterns, you know, come along like we believe they might, then, yeah, the 20 to 30 percent planning, and I emphasize planning, it's difficult to, you know, issue that as guidance when As you know, aftermarket bookings tend to be book and ship. You don't have as much visibility. So this is for planning purposes. And, you know, every business will have a slightly different plan along those lines.

"Yeah, hi. I wanted to follow up, Kevin, on the discussion on the commercial aftermarket. I know your sequential growth has been a little lumpy over the last three quarters, but considering your comment on sort of book and ship and the bookings pace, how should we think about the sequential growth here into the fiscal first quarter of 2022?","Well, I think we're concerned about the first quarter only, I guess, concerned, too strong of a word. You know, we always see a normal dip in, you know, sequential from Q4 to Q1, given the less days. So I think we're always concerned that the market doesn't, you know, accurately predict that. You know, to give you some, you know, reason to you know, believe in what we're saying. You know, the bookings came out for Q4 very strong. And, you know, we booked ahead of shipments. That's as encouraging for us, clearly, and means that we're setting ourselves up for a strong position into 22.

"Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And again, as we think about the up, call it 25% for your planning purposes for the aftermarket for the year, what are your assumptions on travel, say, and takeoffs and landings in Asia or in international markets? I know you don't have great visibility internationally, but are you anticipating a significant recovery in these numbers in international? I'm just trying to get at some of the puts and takes in that 20% to 30% planning range.","Well, and you've really zeroed in on why we struggle to give guidance on these numbers, because I don't have that visibility. I don't understand where it's going to come from. This comes as a roll-up from all of our teams who tell us what they think they see happening in the marketplace based on what the customers are telling them. It's not so easy for me to predict by region, by platform. So we don't, and that's why I'm giving you some you know, planning guidance that what we're planning on should happen, but how it actually gets to us, we don't, it's not so clear where the orders are and where the shipments are, and therefore what traffic needs to look like. And, you know, is the recovery in China, does that happen?

"Hey, good morning, guys. Kevin, Mike, the business was free cash flow positive even at the depths of COVID-19. And considering the defensibility of the business model, how are you thinking about maximum leverage that the balance sheet can support versus what you would have thought pre-COVID? And can you discuss your appetite for large versus small deals?","Sure. On leverage, we don't anticipate any kind of change. If you went back to the pre-COVID two-year period and averaged the quarterly average net debt to EBITDA levels, you get about 6.0 times almost exactly. We're comfortable operating at that level. Some of the, you know, debt incurrence tests and other things in our credit agreement are, you know, based off operating at that level and we're comfortable with it. If anything, this pandemic, as you said, has kind of proven that The business is very durable from a free cash flow standpoint and could probably sustain more leverage than the historical level we've run it at. But we do want to keep some firepower for M&A at all times, including large deals. Moving on to the second part of your question, large deals, as Kevin mentioned, we're more active now on the M&A side at the small to midsize range. But there are also obviously some large potential transactions that we track from time to time. both on the strategic side, but then also big divestitures that could maybe come out of some of the peers of ours in the aerospace industry. So we're always looking and always on the hunt, as you know, whether it's large or small. We're targeting M&A of all sizes from kind of the really low TEV range, below $100 million, up to a couple billion.",2013.22,2094.769,12,2021,4,0.502,3.405,0,-0.0689999999999999,-0.8039999999999994,0,0.475,1.979,0,0.931,4.608,0,0.913,9.294,0,0.969,10.473,0
"I see. And if I could do a follow-up, I mean, looking at the Esterline deal, You found some jewels in there, and you also divested some businesses that may not have necessarily fit the TransDyne model. When you think about the opportunities for large deals, what kind of threshold are you looking at in terms of what you want to keep versus what you want to divest in terms of your appetite for pursuing some of these large deals that may not be 100% TransDyne-y?","Yeah, it's hard to put an exact percentage on something like that. Ultimately, it depends on the on-sale risk, right? If there was something where it was maybe 50-50 and you had someone who wanted to buy the other, you know, 50%, that's a different situation than, you know, Esterline where we sold roughly a quarter of it. So it's hard to answer that question, but, you know, obviously the Esterline transaction proved to us that we can go and buy something that's, you not 100% fit the day we own it, but then execute on M&A in the year or two post-deal close to shape it down to the portfolio that we want to own forever and long-term.

"Okay. Great. Thanks. So, Kevin, I appreciate the color there on MEGIT. Just wanted to ask you about the fact that you were willing to entertain the idea of potentially getting involved in MEGIT given what appears to be pretty high valuations. What does that say about kind of the pipeline, the ability to find large aero deals for you guys from here?","Well, at the end of the day, the market says what a property is worth, and it's up to us to follow what the market says we have to pay. We are looking for highly engineered proprietary aerospace products that have aftermarket access. The size of those businesses doesn't matter as much as we want to identify those and get them into the fold. We believe that we can invest in those businesses and make them stronger. We're not looking for bigger and bigger deals. Our target is to acquire $50 to $100 million a year. That's what works in our model and allows us to keep generating the kinds of value returns that we do. We're not getting overly fixated on doing a large deal, but when they come along, we certainly look at them, we evaluate them, and in the ones that we've proceeded with, I think we've done pretty well.

George can comment on that. But I think we are very disciplined in our approach to adding back. And that is one of the hallmarks of our operations discipline. George, you want to expand on that? Yeah, I would add, you know, the teams have done a lot of heavy lifting in terms of restructuring and productivity focus. The last 12 months, we're pretty comfortable with the resource level that we currently have. I think as most of you know, as the commercial aftermarket rebounds, that's not as heavy in terms of labor requirements or resource requirements.

So how do you think about the, you know, the trajectory there and how you're going to sort of relate to the progress in build rates?","Yeah. In general, we found that the OEMs and the Tier 1s were a little bit slow to respond in mid-year 2020 as the pandemic was ramping up, so we believe there's some natural inventory destocking continuing to go on. The orders are starting to come in. As I mentioned, the bookings were up in the commercial OE in Q4, so that's a positive indicator. I don't have the details in terms of how it lays in across fiscal year 2022, but we don't think there's any significant issue there. It's just the timing and the lag of the OEM shutting off the valve, if you will, on the supply in 2020, and now as they continue to ramp up in production.",2452.435,2501.629,16,2021,4,0.395,5.217,0,-0.0709999999999999,-1.0869999999999993,0,0.5409999999999999,3.678,0,0.939,7.576,0,0.849,12.649,0,0.948,14.144,0

And then just to follow up on financial guidance, just wondering what are the key improvements or catalysts that you might be looking for in the coming periods in the overall market if you'd have the confidence and the visibility to provide full financial guidance?","I think it's... It's market recovery, you know, international markets, people flying again on an international scale and continued domestic travel. We know that business travel isn't a huge percentage of overall flights, but still very important to airlines in how they gear up their fleets and capacitize. So this is what we'd be looking at is, you know, acceptance and continued international flight activity, more domestic recovery in other pockets around the world to look more similar to where the U.S. is, which is very close within, you know, 10 to 20 percent of what it was pre-COVID. So I think those are the things we're looking at. And there's still a lot of unknowns. You see the China's traffic activity bounce around quite a bit. Every couple of months, they're shutting down and then coming back.

And then if you could just comment on expectations for free cash flow conversion?","Yeah, I don't think we want to get and go and provide any long-term guidance. I think, you know, generally just from our analyst day, and if we execute on the value drivers, EBITDA margins at trans time should improve by about one percentage point per year. If we come out of COVID, there's a potential that that gets kind of mixed up a bit, and maybe you'd do better if you mix more towards commercial aftermarket.

We did see some of that in the past. But remember of the defense bucket, the direct-to-government isn't all that significant, right?

"Kevin, your comment that we should not be looking for share repurchase or special dividend in the next quarter, can we interpret that to mean you see a reasonable likelihood of acquisition activity in that period of time? And then if that doesn't play out, how quickly do you start to consider share repurchase or special dividend?","We can't speculate on when acquisitions will happen. You know, we always, and this goes back to what I said earlier in the uses of capital, you know, fund your own internal investment and payback, you know, look for acquisitions, and then, of course, you know, look to get that cash back. We will look to do that, of course, in the appropriate process that we always go through. we can't speculate on when acquisitions might come along or not.

"Thank you. Just to follow up on a couple questions, Noah's last one. On the book to bill, in the aftermarket, it looks like for three quarters, we've had bookings ahead of shipments. And so I have two questions related to that. One, are all shipments at some point booked? Therefore... book to bill is actually a relevant metric and second what's going on there it looks like um you know you've been creating backlog i'm just curious like is that what's happening you're seeing orders for delivery customers want the product but not immediately is that like is there a duration stretch to the backlog that you're seeing in the aftermarket that's what i think you know aftermarket orders","for more immediate shipments. But that doesn't mean they're all due tomorrow. So there is still a little bit of a range over when these things are due. That's why it bleeds over quarter to quarter.

"Fair enough. And just to that point, so you're actually probably seeing some visibility beyond the December quarter in terms of shipments at this point in the aftermarket. And is that unusual to see out?","That's a fair comment. I don't think it's unusual.

Did you leave some sales on the table? Are there delinquencies?

So the math is somewhere around 2.4-ish billion of adjusted EBITDA on that basis. Is that what you were trying to convey or? Are we just talking round numbers here?","No, we're not giving guidance on the denominator there. We're simply trying to give you a rough sense for the deleveraging by about a turn per year. But if you're trying to dial in and back into the EBITDA guide or something, don't do it because you're not going to get the right stat.

The first one is, how much are you budgeting internally for Trans9 business travel spend next year relative to pre-COVID?","We're stepping up a little bit, but not quite to pre-COVID levels. I don't have the exact stats in front of me. It's not quite back to 19 levels, but it's more than 20.

Is this interiors? Is it around freight? I mean, I'm just not going to give too much away, but what are the nature of these projects? Thanks.","Yeah, I mean, generally we don't give that kind of detail. I could say... You know, as we continued to adjust our resource levels, you know, that puts additional pressures on increasing production rates. So we've got a few teams investing in new technologies for automation projects and then a handful of other projects across the ranch.
