I do not have granularity of orders to be able to say, you know, are we seeing more wide body work or not?

So first on the working capital, you'll see when we publish that 10K later today. I don't think you have the full cash flow detail yet, but AR did tick up a bit this quarter. About $100 million went back into accounts receivable. We knew that was going to happen. As a reminder, from peak to trough, about $400 million came out of accounts receivable during COVID. So that's going to have to go in as we go back in, as we go through the rebound here. It did tick up this year over the past couple quarters. As you know, this last quarter was $100 million. That's going to continue. Ultimately, how much goes back into AR and the pace at which that happens depends on the pace of the recovery, but we do expect it to be a use of cash on the order of at least $100 million during our FY22, potentially more. That would be a good problem to have, by the way. I mean, if the commercial markets rebound and we have to invest more in AR, we're happy to do that. We certainly have the cash. And then, sorry, Noah, your second question was on CapEx, I think. We put out a range of 135 to 155 today. It is slightly higher on a percentage basis. It's tied to some one-time projects at some of our op units.

Kevin, Mike, the business was free cash flow positive even at the depths of COVID-19. And considering the defensibility of the business model, how are you thinking about maximum leverage that the balance sheet can support versus what you would have thought pre-COVID? And can you discuss your appetite for large versus small deals?",Mike Lisman,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. On leverage, we don't anticipate any kind of change. If you went back to the pre-COVID two-year period and averaged the quarterly average net debt to EBITDA levels, you get about 6.0 times almost exactly. We're comfortable operating at that level. Some of the, you know, debt incurrence tests and other things in our credit agreement are, you know, based off operating at that level and we're comfortable with it. If anything, this pandemic, as you said, has kind of proven that The business is very durable from a free cash flow standpoint and could probably sustain more leverage than the historical level we've run it at. But we do want to keep some firepower for M&A at all times, including large deals. Moving on to the second part of your question, large deals, as Kevin mentioned, we're more active now on the M&A side at the small to midsize range. But there are also obviously some large potential transactions that we track from time to time. both on the strategic side, but then also big divestitures that could maybe come out of some of the peers of ours in the aerospace industry.

And if I could do a follow-up, I mean, looking at the Esterline deal, You found some jewels in there, and you also divested some businesses that may not have necessarily fit the TransDyne model. When you think about the opportunities for large deals, what kind of threshold are you looking at in terms of what you want to keep versus what you want to divest in terms of your appetite for pursuing some of these large deals that may not be 100% TransDyne-y?",Mike Lisman,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, it's hard to put an exact percentage on something like that. Ultimately, it depends on the on-sale risk, right? If there was something where it was maybe 50-50 and you had someone who wanted to buy the other, you know, 50%, that's a different situation than, you know, Esterline where we sold roughly a quarter of it. So it's hard to answer that question, but, you know, obviously the Esterline transaction proved to us that we can go and buy something that's, you not 100% fit the day we own it, but then execute on M&A in the year or two post-deal close to shape it down to the portfolio that we want to own forever and long-term.

We are looking for highly engineered proprietary aerospace products that have aftermarket access. The size of those businesses doesn't matter as much as we want to identify those and get them into the fold. We believe that we can invest in those businesses and make them stronger.

In general, we found that the OEMs and the Tier 1s were a little bit slow to respond in mid-year 2020 as the pandemic was ramping up, so we believe there's some natural inventory destocking continuing to go on. The orders are starting to come in. As I mentioned, the bookings were up in the commercial OE in Q4, so that's a positive indicator. I don't have the details in terms of how it lays in across fiscal year 2022, but we don't think there's any significant issue there.

It's market recovery, you know, international markets, people flying again on an international scale and continued domestic travel. We know that business travel isn't a huge percentage of overall flights, but still very important to airlines in how they gear up their fleets and capacitize. So this is what we'd be looking at is, you know, acceptance and continued international flight activity, more domestic recovery in other pockets around the world to look more similar to where the U.S. is, which is very close within, you know, 10 to 20 percent of what it was pre-COVID. So I think those are the things we're looking at. And there's still a lot of unknowns. You see the China's traffic activity bounce around quite a bit. Every couple of months, they're shutting down and then coming back.
