Good morning. I appreciate that you're not going to want to give full year guidance at this point, but the second quarter revenue guide was quite strong, I thought, relative to what I was expecting, particularly relative to the first quarter. So can you help me frame out how you're thinking about that trajectory into the back half of the year if these current trends continue? And if it's not a revenue commentary, maybe just help me think about sort of capacities you're exiting 2021.",José Montero,"CFO, Copa Holdings","So let me start, Hunter, and then I'll let Jose answer. uh had some comments so i think as we have mentioned in the past it's really very very difficult to predict the future under the present conditions that we're dealing with including travel restrictions by by many countries and shifting demand patterns and that's why we're only talking about q2 and not the rest of the year but we have enough flexibility in our fleet to add capacity on short notice as we see demand coming in. So we would expect for the second half of the year to maybe this growth trend that we're talking to between Q1 and Q2 to accelerate somewhat, maybe even as much as doubling the growth pace that we're seeing right now, but it's really hard to predict as we speak. Yeah, I think that, Hunter, demand is increasing as of today, but we have seen this before, and, you know, there's still a level of uncertainty in terms of the behavior of the virus in the region. So things are still volatile, as Pedro mentioned. But, you know, as of today, for the second half, we could see sort of the same trend that we're seeing sort of the first quarter into the second half as well.

Just one or two quick ones for me. You know, I was intrigued, Pedro, you mentioned, you know, the kind of inability in my mind to do point-to-points. especially in that region. But what sort of competitive trends or opportunities are you seeing for Wingo? And then the second question, if you could just refresh my memory, you guys have been running four daily flight banks, and you're going to six by the end of June, if I heard that correctly?",Pedro Heilbrón,"CEO, Copa Holdings","Yeah, that is correct. I'll start with the second question. So we've operated a six-bank hop since ??Since 2011, we've been operating at six banks. We've obviously reduced all of that since the pandemic started. But we're going back in June. By the end of June, we'll be back at six banks. So at least that's our intention, which will give us a lot more flexibility in putting together a better network or scheduling flights in a more efficient and effective way. So it's not that that's going to drive our growth, but it will drive a better schedule and better rotation of aircraft for the remaining of the year. And then in terms of Wingo, so Wingo started pre-pandemic with four 737-800s. and is now operating six 727-800. So they've actually increased capacity by about 50% since the pandemic started and have opened a few new domestic and international stores. So they're still affected by the pandemic. Colombia, of course, is still affected, even though domestic markets have recuperated a little bit better than international markets.

Perhaps it's kind of a little early to tell, but can you please provide some color on the path to recover your profitability levels after COVID? How should we expect yields to perform in light of lower corporate demand and perhaps with weaker effects and higher old prices, how are you going to pivot from low margins to the margins that you have pre-COVID? Thank you.",Pedro Heilbrón,"CEO, Copa Holdings","Yeah, Pablo, this is Jose here. So I would say that, you know, we have to take a basis on where do we think, what's the path to sort of bring our revenues, our unit revenues, from the place where they are today into a lower dilution and how we match our capacity to sort of that revenue environment. So I think that if we assume that in the medium term our unit revenue dilution is sort of in the mid-teens, we could reach an operating P&L break-even at 60% of our pre-COVID capacity. I think that taking that a further step, if we were to assume a, you know, univariate use being at their pre-COVID levels, we could reach our pre-COVID level of operating margins in the teens at a much lower capacity that we had uh than than the pre-code 19 levels we could be at maybe you know 60 to 70 percent of our pre-code capacity assuming uh zero revenue dilution, we will be achieving our pre-COVID sort of mid-teen operating margin levels. So that's, I mean, just to give you some of the frameworks where we are at. And of course, that's a function of all the efficiencies that we're working in in terms of our costs going forward. And Pablo, I'll add to that. You asked for some color. So... you know, a lot of the work we've put in since the pandemic started to make the company more cost efficient is with the new reality that you referred to in our mind. So if there's going to be less business traffic for a while, yields are going to be affected, but if we can deliver lower cost, which is our intention, then we'll be able to have the same success as before or even more at a yield at a revenue dilution or a yield dilution over pre-pandemic.",positive,0.557,neutral,0.636,neutral,0.501,positive,0.97,positive,0.897,positive,0.973,3,0.557,0,0,0.97,0.897,0.973,1.637,0,0.456,2.787,2.646,2.907,0,0,0,0,0,0

And we're going to be at pre-pandemic KASM when we reach 80%, which that should not be... too far from now. We're also connecting small markets. The strength of our hub is that we connect over 70% of our markets. Our markets are too small to be able to be served non-stop directly. That's not going to change after the pandemic, at least not for a while. And it's also hard to stimulate traffic in many markets in Latin America, not only because of the size of the market, but because of how high the airport fees and taxes are. So before you start charging a penny, the passenger has to pay quite a large amount of money. So it's hard to stimulate new traffic with those kind of We also have ??we're part of a strong alliance with United and Star Alliance.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of a follow-up on the first question. If you were to estimate how capacity recovery was among leisure and BFR, what would it be your best guess? And kind of a related question to that one, to what extent do you think that vaccination tourism helped demand over the quarter? Thank you.",Pedro Helron,"CEO, Copa Holdings","I will start by saying, Pablo, that what we're seeing right now in terms of the breakdown of the type of demand that we have is that, yeah, it's being driven by VFR. I would say that VFR is almost half of the traffic that we're seeing. I'm sorry, leisure is about half, a little bit less than half in leisure, and followed by VFR about a third. And then as Pedro mentioned before, business travel is down, I want to say, half versus where it was before the pandemic. So it now represents maybe 15% to 20% of our total traffic. That's the breakdown that we are seeing right now. But of course, again, the pandemic has taught us that things change over time. So this is the picture that we have as of today. And in terms of vaccine tourism to the U.S., it's obviously impossible for us to know the reasons people travel for. But there was an increase in two from the U.S. traffic sometimes towards the end of April. when vaccines were kind of openly available in the U.S. So that obviously led us to believe that one thing is tied to the other. And we're seeing a slowdown right now. You know, as more vaccines are available in Latin American countries and as people get vaccinated, you know, there's an initial rush and we expect that to continue slowing down. But as you know, we have a very strong network that's not dependent on one particular market or one particular sector. So we'll keep on rebuilding our network and leveraging those strengths.

And how should we think about your capacity over the next few quarters if things remain as they are today?

Thanks.",Jose Montero,"CFO, Copa Holdings","Yeah, so Pedro here. If we compare to pre-pandemic, let's say to 2019, we were, by the end of 2019, we were operating 96 aircraft. We had 102, but that included 6, max 9, which were not operating, were grounded, as we know. So in 2019, by the end of 2019, we operated 96 as COPPA holdings. By the end of 2021, we'll have 89 as COPPA holdings. We might still have a few in the desert, which we have to reactivate, but that can happen in the first part of 2022. And then we have five max nine deliveries in 2022. So that's going to take us to, you know, we also have lease returns, which we have to decide how many we're going to return or not. We're guiding now that we will renew some of those leases. And then our aircraft are of higher gauge because we've sold the Embraer 190s. So we're operating mostly 800 NGs and max 9, so much higher gauge than the Embraers. So shortly, sometime, right now, we will not be at 100%, but we can be in the high 80s by the end of this year. And sometime towards the second half of 2022, we could be close to the 100% in ASMs. And in terms of costs, Bert, you know, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter, but if we are in, you know, if demand trends sort of go on in the way that we expect them to, you know, our unit costs for the fourth quarter could be in the low six cent range.",positive,0.514,neutral,0.686,neutral,0.748,positive,0.965,positive,0.912,positive,0.973,17,0.514,0,0,0.965,0.912,0.973,6.166,0,2.16,10.157,13.999,13.822,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions here. So first question really ties to the vaccine rollout across your network, the countries you serve versus the expectation for business travel to recover. So I think every country has got a different vaccine rollout, of course. If you were to take some kind of average of the various rollouts, I'm just wondering what that expectation for when your markets would be fully vaccinated is that you know, early 2022, you know, Brazil by year-end, but for the whole network, early 2022, or is it end of 2022, or does it really tie to an earlier question, you know, sometime mid-next year? And then related to that vaccine rollout, you know, what is the expectation? Does business travel recover ahead of that rollout, or is it, you know, coincide with it or lag it? You know, what can you share along those lines? So...",Jose Montero,"CFO, Copa Holdings","I'll take the first shot at it and then I'll let Jose back me up. In Panama, for example, we think that by the month of September, so a month from now, anyone that wants a vaccine will have access to a vaccine. We are about 80%, I'm sorry, 40% vaccinated right now, but the vaccines are coming in at a very fast pace on a weekly basis And I think in a month, anyone that wants to get vaccinated will be able to get vaccinated. It seems to be going that way also in Colombia from what we know. And it's just gaining steam in most countries in Latin America. So I would hope that by the end of the year, so by the end of the fourth quarter, the countries will be vaccinated to the degree that the population wants to get vaccinated. And in terms of corporate travel coming back, so we've heard from some of the major accounts that they'll start traveling after the summer, but we know that it won't be at the same rate than before, in the same percentage as pre-pandemic. Also, Latin America is made up of a lot of small companies and regional multi-Latin American companies, and I think those are going to start traveling soon. probably sooner than the larger international or U.S. corporations. But we cannot really predict exactly how that's going to play out. Yeah, I just add, Dan, that the business traveler that travels on COPPA, there's a big component there of small business owners or people who work for very small companies. And we believe, as Pedro mentioned, that those folks will get back in the air in a shorter term than sort of the big corporate accounts.",positive,0.523,neutral,0.606,positive,0.546,positive,0.961,positive,0.903,positive,0.971,19,0.523,0,0.546,0.961,0.903,0.971,7.243,0,3.297,11.118,15.745,15.662,0,0,0,0,0,0

So that ties to, I guess, my second question here, and it's really kind of a two-pronged question. It kind of gets back to, I think, an earlier question, Savi, just on the yield expectation for the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you can You know, help us understand what really happened in the second quarter. Were yields initially weaker and then stronger towards the end? And, you know, how does that tie to the third quarter? I mean, if corporate travel comes back, it sounds like that might not be embedded into the third quarter revenue outlook. And then, you know, kind of related to that, are there any countries in Latin America looking to Europe as a model for how to open, so requiring a vaccine passport potentially as a way to bypass testing and quarantines?",Jose Montero,"CFO, Copa Holdings","Yeah, I would say for the third quarter, first of all, the news story in the second quarter was... I think it was mostly towards the latter part of the second quarter, more than in the beginning. And it, I think, was... As a function of several items, there was, as Pedro mentioned before, there was some vaccine tourism to the U.S., but also there was, I think, an opening of certain countries started to open, especially in the Caribbean and in Mexico. So that created, I think, that bump in demand that we saw. And it was mostly, again, during the latter part of the second quarter. And what we're seeing right now is that in the third quarter specifically, the latter part of the third quarter is where we're seeing that there is a little bit of a yuga. But the important thing here, however, is also that we're putting in quite a bit of additional capacity into the third quarter. So I think it's not necessarily a story of weakness, but rather the fact that we are adding capacity into a network in order to build the network back.

Hey, everybody. Hey, Pedro, in your response to Alejandro's question earlier about holding on to the 6737-700s, you gave two reasons.

I think you're doing now nine round trips, which pre-COVID, I can't even think that, I mean, I think around the holidays you got to nine round trips.

When we think of larger gauge aircraft, and as we said in the past, and you know us well, we try to keep things as simple as possible so we can have a simple single fleet as much as possible. Right now we are a 737 operator, exclusively 737, mainly NG-800s and MAXs. MAX 9 is very simple. There's pilot commonalities, the whole thing. And sometimes we sacrifice having the ideal aircraft or the ideal gauge in a few markets in exchange for having the better fleet for the whole network. And we're going to keep that mentality. And if the MAX 10 is something we're going to bring in, it needs to make sense in more than just one route, more than just Miami, etc. We would rather run wingtips in some markets, knowing that that facilitates the having a single, narrow body, very efficient fleet. So that's kind of what we're weighing out always. commonality, simplicity versus the ideal aircraft for each market, which is hard to do. And that's also going to drive any future decision about a smaller gauge aircraft, which was your first question. That same philosophy is going to drive that. In terms of the broken itineraries, we're in a recovery mode ourselves, so we're rebuilding our network. and our six-band connectivity, which started late in June. So we'll take advantage of any opportunities that fit that single hub model, but we are in that recovery mode, so I cannot say that we're taking full advantage of everything.

I haven't asked this question in previous quarters because I didn't think you had enough shells to really give a good answer, but when we think about the uptake in the premium cabin, what are you seeing?

And so far, we've been getting a premium for the DREAMS product. And also, I should say, that our costs are better than options through other hubs or nonstop options when they are.

Honestly, this pandemic has been very difficult to predict. and even three months ahead it's like you know two years in normal times so so the man came back at least in this quarter and what we're seeing in the next few quarters much faster and stronger than what we would have expected you know some months ago so so i think that's important to keep in mind that that times are very different in the old days we could predict things but We grew capacity quarter over quarter, 50%, and it was hard to tell then how demand was going to react. Back in November of 2020, which seems like 10 years ago, We grew capacity quite a bit from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021, and demand did not show up, not materialize, so we had to pull back. So that's kind of the things we're dealing with in this pandemic. So, you know, it's always good for demand to remain strong, and that's kind of what we're hoping or what we're seeing right now.

We... we are about you know in the next maybe month and a half or two months we would have brought back from furlough all of our pilots we we have already brought back all of our flight attendants and we're even rehiring a flight attendant that took voluntary leave programs and after that group will start hiring new new flight attendants so in so in pilots we will soon bring back everyone that that was in furlough. We have pilots that took voluntary leave. We've contacted them, and a high percent of them is willing to come back. And we're also strengthening our own in-house pilot academy, so we're growing that also. So right now, we feel we're fine in that respect.

And then a related one is also I believe that Avianca's new CEO made comments in the press recently that their line is shifting to a point-to-point strategy and just wanted to hear your views on the relevance of that announcement for COPPA.",Pedro Hebron,CEO,"Yes, so they have announced. I mean, U.S. carriers have brought back capacity to a higher level than pre-pandemic. So most, if not all, U.S. carriers are offering more ASMs now than what they offered in 2019. I'm talking in Latin America. Some of the major hub and spoke carriers that went or are going through Chapter 11 procedures, so they are below, but then everyone else is above 2019. So it's a mixture there. Yes, Avianca, as you well mentioned, made declarations, and I think they even kind of published their Chapter 11 exit plan or something, and it's going to be more of a low-cost strategy with densified planes, point-to-point service, and lower yields. So, yes, we've heard that, and we're confident that we will be able to maintain our cost advantage and be able to compete under any scenario, and we are prepared for that, and we're preparing further for that kind of competitive environment.",positive,0.59,neutral,0.66,neutral,0.527,positive,0.786,positive,0.927,positive,0.966,17,0.59,0,0,0.786,0.927,0.966,6.814,0,3.533,8.466,14.247,15.247,0,0,0,0,0,0

What we're seeing is that people want to fly and travel like they did before the pandemic, and in a way it's been surprising to the degree that this is going on. We are not seeing the fear of traveling that we expected maybe a year ago or nine months ago. And I think it's just regular demand.

Your line is open.,Jose Montero,"CFO, COPPA Holdings","Good morning, gentlemen, and many thanks for taking my question. Kind of two very quick ones for you. The first, am I correct in thinking that you guys are probably not under significant pressure in terms of your pilot pipeline, just thinking about the more significant dislocation among the Latin Airlines versus the U.S., and considering maybe there's some pilots out there looking for work. Just sort of wanted a high-level understanding how you guys are seeing your pilot supply. Right. So short-term, we are okay. We have still pilots that took voluntary leave during the pandemic that we can bring back. We activated every pilot that was on furlough. but we still have the voluntary leaves we can bring back. We also have an interesting pipeline from our own flight academy, and we're going to have, at the end of the year, about 100 pilots there that we will incorporate into the airline. So we're thinking it's more medium-term, and we think that we're taking the necessary steps to be fine also medium-term and beyond. Okay, great color, Pedro. I definitely appreciate that. And just one other quick one for me. I was intrigued by what you guys mentioned about converting one of your 737-8s into a freighter. Is this something that you might consider doing with other 737-8s, or do you kind of see it as a one-off? You know, that should kind of be a narrative medium term thing as the pandemic winds down. Right. So a few things there. First is that we made that decision when we had our aircraft in the desert. We're not flying and cargo was booming worldwide and in the region. And in hindsight, it was the right decision. And we expect that aircraft to produce on a single airplane basis better profits than our last passenger or less profitable passenger aircraft. So it was a good decision and we have an option for a second conversion in the coming years and also these are our oldest non-Boeing Sky Interior 800s. The other thing I would add is that we charter We're already chartering. We've been chartering for a while freighter aircraft that fly regionally. Many of the hours are going to be replacement. Our own freighter, a much more efficient 800 freighter, is going to replace a less efficient 727 freighter we charter for regional flying, and then we'll add hours to that. So we're really happy with the decision. It's not turning us into a big-time freighter carrier. It's more of a niche opportunity, but I think it complements well the rest of our business.

I think that the principal component of our CASM reduction that we've seen so far is related to the fleet movements that we've made. We've moved away from the U-190 fleet, which was part of our initial assessment in terms of how to move into a sub-6 CASM. I would say that Again, we are ahead of the plan in the sense that what we published back in 2019 assumed a larger COPPA, so a lot of the benefits that we're going to get in terms of size and size of the company were going to flow down into a KASM figure. we are achieving that in a smaller COPPA. So, we're achieving the subseq chasm, we're saying at 93% of pre-COVID capacity. So it is actually ahead of that. And I would say that some of the items that we've had in terms of overhead that we've reduced probably are on the margin. I don't think it's necessarily that material in terms of where the castle will be. Maybe the castle will be just above six. But that certainly has made a difference, the fact that we have actually accelerated some of the fleet moves that we've made. been very effective in renegotiating a lot of contracts and also worked a lot in terms of overhead.

And then on the unitary revenue, the guidance for the first quarter 2022 shows some implicit reduction relative to the fourth quarter 2021. So would you say that it's fully explained by Omicron and how can we think about yields for the remaining year?",Jose Montero,"CFO, COPPA Holdings","Yeah, I'll start by talking about Q1 and indeed it is related to Omicron in terms of the revenue figures. I would say that it is solely related to Omicron. There's two components to Omicron. One is cancellations that we had, which reduce our revenue figures. It might not necessarily affect as much on a P&L basis because it's resulting in cancellations. And then the other portion of it is just a pure sort of softening during the month of January and February related to how we're seeing demand. So that's on the top line. But I think that when you match this to profitability for Q1 and kind of what our guidance is for Q1, the range that we have for an operating margin, there is also the impact of fuel in there. We have fuel that is 15% higher on our cost basis versus what we had in Q4. So that's another component of it. I would say, I mean, kind of deconstructing a little bit sort of the operating margin between Q4 and Q1, that about two-thirds of the reduction in margin that we're seeing quarter over quarter is related to the Omicron sort of impact and about a third related to fuel. As to the rest of the year, you know, I think it's too early to make an assessment for the rest of the year. I mean, we, I think, are confident in terms of what we're seeing in terms of capacity going forward, but I think there's still a lot of a lot of water to flow on the bridge in terms of going to put an assessment just whether revenues are going to be for the rest of the year.",positive,0.502,neutral,0.668,neutral,0.672,positive,0.978,positive,0.915,positive,0.975,6,0.502,0,0,0.978,0.915,0.975,2.643,0,1.151,4.488,5.21,5.813,0,0,0,0,0,0

And the bigger markets in our region, including the U.S., are open and are behaving in similar ways. The U.S., Brazil, other countries in South America, Colombia. They're all open, and Mexico the same. It's always been open. And so we're seeing traffic flowing among those countries.

Anyway, Pedro, I want to go back to in previous periods, over the years since you guys have been a public company, one of the things that I always thought that you stood out versus other carriers, whether around the region or the world, was your ability to recapture higher fuel prices in your fare structure. Historically, You've done a pretty good job, and I can even recall you saying, you know, look, you know, we were able to get 100%. And I know there's a lag, and maybe that lag is, you know, three months, five months. And I don't know if it's because you fly 99% of your services international, right? So there are fuel surcharges. You do get that benefit. And you also fly to a lot of countries that, you know, where their economies actually tend to do well. when commodity prices are rising. And that's what we're seeing around the world right now. Just look at the Brazilian stock market. It's up pretty meaningfully. So I don't know, do you feel like that your business and the competition and the backdrop that you can say that you'll be able to recapture 100%? And I'm just curious, in the March quarter, underlying your 3% to 6% operating margin guide, what's your assumption? Are you assuming maybe you recapture 100%? 50% of the run-up in fuel, 75%? Is there some percentage that you can give us? So I realize it's kind of a long and sort of comprehensive type question, but, you know, it obviously matters a lot to your P&L in the March quarter and where you think you could be for the year.",Jose Montero,"CFO, COPPA Holdings","Right. So staying in the 727 old-timers category, the 100% recapture comment, was actually in 2007 or 2008, if I'm not mistaken, which was the last time, actually, that Phil went through the roof. Maybe not the last time, but when it kind of got the worst. The reason, and I'll let Jose kind of round off what I'm saying, the reason we're not expecting or banking on recapturing the increase in fuel price is just all the uncertainty related to the virus and how we're bringing back capacity and how competition is less predictable. The traffic flows, it's more leisure, less business, so also harder to change prices in some markets from one day to the other. So it's just the whole business environment It's very different right now. And I know the waters will settle and things will normalize as the year progresses, but we don't want to make any bets right now or any promises. Our PRM team, as always, will do its best to recapture as much as we can, hopefully all. But it will take longer, I think, than before. No, I would just add that the other component there is currencies in the region, and the currency environment in Latin America is still not as predictable maybe as it would have been in other times. So that's another component of this, right, in terms of purchasing power. And I have to second what Pedro mentioned in terms of our ??pricing and revenue management practice, which is world class and they're excellent at what they do and they capture as much as they can from every ASM that we sell. So it's very important. And then the other thing, however, I think that the other aspect that has changed or that we are really focusing on is our own controllable costs and so our our chasm x today is much lower than where it was back in 07 and and that's another big component of our ultimate profitability that we're that we're striving for okay okay great then just one quick follow-up um um since you sort of said you know that obviously given the current backdrop you know obviously a lot more discretionary than say corporate but",positive,0.559,neutral,0.606,neutral,0.663,positive,0.967,positive,0.806,positive,0.976,16,0.559,0,0,0.967,0.806,0.976,5.707,0,1.151,7.527,12.984,14.672,0,0,0,1,0,0

You know, when should we be more confident that yields are going to likely increase with demand normalizing. So any color on capacity deployment and how much aircraft is still grounded from competitors would be great.",Pedro Hebron,"CEO, COPPA Holdings","Right. So I would say that capacity market share has been a little bit all over the place in Latin America. Some airlines have... deployed capacity faster than others. I mean, there's some that are above pre-pandemic capacity and others are, you know, still behind. We are like in the middle. We're very close. And by the second half of this year, we will be at a pre-pandemic capacity. So again, some are above some of the U.S. carriers, even some carriers in our region are above, and some of the main airlines that went through the Chapter 11 process are a little bit behind. And all of that alters the market share numbers too. So again, I think we stayed like in the middle, and we're following our course. We are focusing on our network, on what makes sense to us, on bringing back the capacity that we know we can fly profitably.

Is it that Wingo's CASMX is sub-five, just given the higher utilization model, and then that helps to drive the sub-six CASMX story at the system level? Or is the cost story really being driven as much on the COPUS side, just given the cost restructuring you've done there?",Jose Montero,"CFO, COPPA Holdings","It's both.

And the second question that I have really is just kind of putting a finer point on some of the prior questions, and that is I'm wondering if you can just provide some perspective on the percent of overall flying, you know, say ballpark to the top five countries. And the reason I'm asking is at least when I dug into the schedules, it looks like flying in the first quarter is a bit more concentrated than it normally would be. So, you know, it looks like you're clearly making some deliberate network decisions here just to leverage some in the near term?",Jose Montero,"CFO, COPPA Holdings","I would say that we're taking opportunities as they come, but it's been bouncing out more than where we were maybe Q2 of last year where there was a clear traffic going to the U.S. for vaccine tourism and the like. Now there's quite a bit in terms of leisure activities but it is, I think, more balanced than where we were last year. And then there's some countries that have opened up. That's your item here. Some countries in South America were very closed during the second and third quarter of last year, and as they've opened, we've added some capacity into those markets as well.",positive,0.538,neutral,0.689,positive,0.518,positive,0.623,positive,0.83,positive,0.894,23,0.538,0,0.518,0.623,0.83,0.894,8.509,0,3.398,10.938,18.756,20.879,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can I just squeeze one last one here? You know, I always am asking questions on pent-up demand to all the airlines.

So I'm going to have to give you a very, very general, but we'll get back to you. I'm going to have to give you a very general answer here, and I think what's encouraging is that we are seeing appetite for travel throughout the region, especially for leisure travel, not only to Copa markets, but to Europe, to everywhere. Skiing season in the US, some are Copa markets, some are not. to Caribbean destinations. So in general, we do not see that people are hesitant about traveling abroad. And there's still some pent-up demand, or if it's no longer pent-up, it's the urge to get out and do things and go somewhere. So in that sense, we are very, very optimistic. on the rest of the year, even though, you know, corporate demand is really hard to predict right now for many reasons. But what we see in general is people are willing and want to travel. And if something like you had a plan in January couldn't occur because of Omicron, we're seeing people say, okay, I'm going to go in on Easter weekend and, you know, that sort of thing. So it's not like people are somehow cancel and it's just simply they're postponing their travel. And that's a good point also because the booking curve has shortened. So for all the reasons we know with the virus and travel restrictions and the like, there's more people making their travel plan a lot closer to the traveling date.",positive,0.597,neutral,0.656,positive,0.658,positive,0.625,positive,0.902,positive,0.854,25,0.597,0,0.658,0.625,0.902,0.854,9.106,0,4.056,11.563,20.378,22.628,1,0,1,0,0,0
