"Hey, good morning, everyone. Good morning. I appreciate that you're not going to want to give full year guidance at this point, but the second quarter revenue guide was quite strong, I thought, relative to what I was expecting, particularly relative to the first quarter. So can you help me frame out how you're thinking about that trajectory into the back half of the year if these current trends continue? And if it's not a revenue commentary, maybe just help me think about sort of capacities you're exiting 2021.","So let me start, Hunter, and then I'll let Jose answer. uh had some comments so i think as we have mentioned in the past it's really very very difficult to predict the future under the present conditions that we're dealing with including travel restrictions by by many countries and shifting demand patterns and that's why we're only talking about q2 and not the rest of the year but we have enough flexibility in our fleet to add capacity on short notice as we see demand coming in. So we would expect for the second half of the year to maybe this growth trend that we're talking to between Q1 and Q2 to accelerate somewhat, maybe even as much as doubling the growth pace that we're seeing right now, but it's really hard to predict as we speak. Yeah, I think that, Hunter, demand is increasing as of today, but we have seen this before, and, you know, there's still a level of uncertainty in terms of the behavior of the virus in the region. So things are still volatile, as Pedro mentioned. But, you know, as of today, for the second half, we could see sort of the same trend that we're seeing sort of the first quarter into the second half as well. But that's, again, we have to just really be mindful that it is the picture that we have today.",817.083,913.535,1,2021,1,0.384,0.384,0,-0.064,-0.064,0,0.364,0.364,0,0.8,0.8,0,0.814,0.814,0,0.968,0.968,0
"Yes, good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just one or two quick ones for me. You know, I was intrigued, Pedro, you mentioned, you know, the kind of inability in my mind to do point-to-points. especially in that region. But what sort of competitive trends or opportunities are you seeing for Wingo? And then the second question, if you could just refresh my memory, you guys have been running four daily flight banks, and you're going to six by the end of June, if I heard that correctly?","Yeah, that is correct. I'll start with the second question. So we've operated a six-bank hop since – Since 2011, we've been operating at six banks. We've obviously reduced all of that since the pandemic started. But we're going back in June. By the end of June, we'll be back at six banks. So at least that's our intention, which will give us a lot more flexibility in putting together a better network or scheduling flights in a more efficient and effective way. So it's not that that's going to drive our growth, but it will drive a better schedule and better rotation of aircraft for the remaining of the year. And then in terms of Wingo, so Wingo started pre-pandemic with four 737-800s. and is now operating six 727-800. So they've actually increased capacity by about 50% since the pandemic started and have opened a few new domestic and international stores. So they're still affected by the pandemic. Colombia, of course, is still affected, even though domestic markets have recuperated a little bit better than international markets. But Wingo did see an opportunity to strengthen their network, and they've done so.",957.936,1054.556,2,2021,1,0.4639999999999999,0.8479999999999999,0,-0.068,-0.132,0,0.342,0.706,0,0.931,1.731,0,0.863,1.677,0,0.955,1.923,0
"Hi, thanks for taking my question. Perhaps it's kind of a little early to tell, but can you please provide some color on the path to recover your profitability levels after COVID? How should we expect yields to perform in light of lower corporate demand and perhaps with weaker effects and higher old prices, how are you going to pivot from low margins to the margins that you have pre-COVID? Thank you.","Yeah, Pablo, this is Jose here. So I would say that, you know, we have to take a basis on where do we think, what's the path to sort of bring our revenues, our unit revenues, from the place where they are today into a lower dilution and how we match our capacity to sort of that revenue environment. So I think that if we assume that in the medium term our unit revenue dilution is sort of in the mid-teens, we could reach an operating P&L break-even at 60% of our pre-COVID capacity. I think that taking that a further step, if we were to assume a, you know, univariate use being at their pre-COVID levels, we could reach our pre-COVID level of operating margins in the teens at a much lower capacity that we had uh than than the pre-code 19 levels we could be at maybe you know 60 to 70 percent of our pre-code capacity assuming uh zero revenue dilution, we will be achieving our pre-COVID sort of mid-teen operating margin levels. So that's, I mean, just to give you some of the frameworks where we are at. And of course, that's a function of all the efficiencies that we're working in in terms of our costs going forward. And Pablo, I'll add to that. You asked for some color. So... you know, a lot of the work we've put in since the pandemic started to make the company more cost efficient is with the new reality that you referred to in our mind. So if there's going to be less business traffic for a while, yields are going to be affected, but if we can deliver lower cost, which is our intention, then we'll be able to have the same success as before or even more at a yield at a revenue dilution or a yield dilution over pre-pandemic.",1108.375,1249.675,3,2021,1,0.44,1.2879999999999998,0,-0.07,-0.202,0,0.39,1.096,0,0.961,2.692,0,0.863,2.54,0,0.964,2.887,0
"Good morning. This is actually Ray on for Dwayne. As you look across your portfolio markets in light of travel restrictions and reopenings, Which are getting better and easier to predict and which are harder to plan as compared to the 1Q commentary that you laid out earlier in your press release?","You mean in terms of markets? In terms of restrictions in markets. Yeah, it's really hard to predict.",1279.502,1285.763,4,2021,1,0.128,1.416,0,-0.061,-0.263,0,0.002,1.098,0,-0.218,2.474,0,0.7699999999999999,3.31,0,0.947,3.834,0
"Yeah, you laid out a bunch of countries and just, you know, kind of an update.","Yeah. So right now, for example, there are very strict restrictions in places such as Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, even some in Panama for South American travelers, not flight restrictions, but in these other countries I've mentioned, in most of them, flights are actually restricted. So it's anyone's guess when those restrictions will be lifted. They will be lifted, of course. They will control the virus. Things will get better. We know that. But it's very difficult to know if that's going to happen in July, in September, or... or who knows. And in many cases, those are new restrictions that were not in place at the end of last year. And there could be other countries imposing new restrictions as things change. But I would say that directionally, I think Even though there's like something like a third wave in many countries of the virus, I think directionally we're going in the right direction in terms of vaccination rates and travel demand and getting things under control.",1290.244,1367.571,5,2021,1,0.3369999999999999,1.753,0,-0.063,-0.326,0,0.185,1.283,0,0.7090000000000001,3.1830000000000003,0,0.7110000000000001,4.021,0,0.916,4.75,0
"And if I can just sort of follow up in here. I appreciate the UGAOS's delivery to the balance of the air. But could you also maybe give us some of the corresponding capex around that and also the capex and deliveries for 22? And as related, what do you think the balance between lease and own would be?","Yeah, Ray, the capex for 2021, including the airplanes that we were already taking delivery of, so talking about full year, total capex is going to be around $450 million. And that's mostly aircraft. There's a portion of it that is cash capex that is associated with maintenance events and IT investments, et cetera. That's around 50 out of that 450. And then for next year, you could assume that it's going to be between 350 to 400 total capex, again, both including aircraft and other type of capex. So that's basically where we're at. You had another follow up on that? What was the second question that you asked? Great. Okay. All right. We'll get in touch with you to answer the other question that you have. All right.

"Oh, hey, Jose, Pedro, Joe. Hey, my one question is just a modeling question here. You know, obviously... The tax was basically zero. And I'm just curious whether or not have you taken a valuation allowance against your deferred tax asset to the extent that now you're not going to be booking any tax credits? Is that what's going on forward? Or was this just some sort of anomaly or timing difference in this quarter? And next quarter, we should just assume it moves back to 10%.","Yeah, it's a timing. The specific line that we put into the fourth quarter was a loss carry forward that got booked. That usually gets done at the moment where you have a clear visibility about the performance of the entire year. So it's done towards the end of the year. So it's just simply timing. So the difference that we saw in the tax line on this quarter It was purely timing, and it would depend on if there's further sort of tax credits or tax loss reports that we declare depend on the performance of the entire year, and they would usually be put in in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how that works here.",1505.557,1550.887,7,2021,1,0.312,2.332,0,-0.075,-0.461,0,-0.028,1.262,0,0.4679999999999999,4.555,0,0.84,5.644,0,0.961,6.675,0
"Hey, good morning. I'm just kind of curious relative to your kind of what you're seeing from a selling standpoint today, how much of your kind of current ATL is in terms of vouchers and kind of what percent of that, you know, what you're selling today is in the kind of the form of vouchers and somewhat related to that is kind of curious if you're seeing any change in business demand recovery.","Yeah, in terms of ATL, you know, the vast majority of the growth that we saw, I think we had a growth in the quarter of about $5 million in the ATL, and it's purely, I would say most of it is cash coming in. So, yeah, the majority of it is cash. There is a portion, but it's a minor portion that's associated with vouchers and the like for future travel. The majority of it is actual cash coming in. Yeah, and we're not seeing a significant recovery in business demand. Of course, there is more business demand than some months ago, but nothing significant yet. It's mostly VFR and leisure.",1584.685,1629.624,8,2021,1,0.423,2.755,0,-0.062,-0.523,0,0.1139999999999999,1.376,0,0.908,5.463,0,0.91,6.554,0,0.965,7.64,0

"Hi, Pedro. Hi, Jose, Raul. Thanks for the call. Just a question in terms of the traffic recovery and the city pairs or routes. So which markets continue closed at this point and what's the expectation to open them? And perhaps the expected recovery may be more driven by the reopening of routes or by increased capacity of existing routes.","Yeah. So, I mean, most markets are open, but some, as I mentioned before, are very restricted in terms of how many frequencies we can operate to markets such as Venezuela, Argentina, Chile and others I mentioned before have restrictions that don't allow us to operate more than a few frequencies per week whereas before we would have had multiple frequencies per day, and that's impacting demand. And there are also other travel restrictions around the region. In the markets that are open, like the U.S. and the Caribbean, for example, we're seeing a stronger demand than in the restricted markets that it would be expected.",1691.705,1748.0,10,2021,1,0.34,3.171,0,-0.0659999999999999,-0.6549999999999999,0,0.1619999999999999,1.5059999999999998,0,0.6100000000000001,6.357,0,0.887,8.161,0,0.967,9.529,0
"Thanks. Good morning. Pedro, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you think fewer markets will be able to support point-to-point post-COVID. Can you just elaborate on that? Why do you think that?","Well, yeah, our hard point has always distinguished itself by connecting a large number of small city pairs. Over 70% of the city pairs we connect have less than 20 passengers per day each way. Post-pandemic, we expect city pairs that have enough traffic that don't fall maybe within that 70%, but even some that do, that pre-pandemic had enough traffic for nonstop service. And I'm not saying every city pair. I'm just saying some additional city pairs will need a hub and Panama is the best place hub to serve those markets. So we think there will be additional opportunities to strengthen the hub of the Americas. And it could be Again, city pairs that can only be served through Panama, whereas before they had nonstop flights, or city pairs that would be able to sustain much less nonstop capacity than pre-pandemic. And, of course, that will change over time, but coming out of this crisis, I think the help of the Americans in Panama is going to be in an even stronger position to serve all those markets.",1776.642,1860.43,11,2021,1,0.517,3.688,0,-0.064,-0.7189999999999999,1,0.513,2.019,0,0.883,7.24,0,0.897,9.058,0,0.967,10.496,1
"Okay, that's helpful. And then, Jose, maybe just following up on Pablo's question, can you remind us how you're thinking about kind of cost structure post-COVID? I think you previously said you could get back to pre-COVID CASMEX with 80% of pre-COVID capacity. Is that still how you're thinking about it? And then just a clarification on the ending the year with 83 aircraft. Does that include stored or parked aircraft? Thank you.","Yeah, so the first question, Joe, is we think that we'll get sub-6 chasm by the time that we are back to pre-COVID capacity. And I think we'll be back to our pre-COVID chasm by the time that we're around 80%. Yeah, that's still very much our target, and we're relatively confident about that target. We've been making a lot of efforts in terms of contract renegotiations and savings in overhead and the fleet moves that we've made. So it's still very much in our radar. And then in terms of... The 83 aircraft at the end of the year. We are all total aircraft, including the stored aircraft. By the way, Joe, I mentioned in our script that we have right now 16 airplanes that are under long-term storage. They're included, of course, in the 81 that we have right now. By the end of the year, we'll end up with 83 aircraft, and we expect right now to have seven under long-term storage by then, including those 83.

"Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for your time. As you think about adding cities back to the network, how will you think about adding them back? Will it be a focus of VFR or leisure traffic, cities first, or how should we think about the shift in mix away from business travel and to more leisure and VFR for now?","An interesting question because the cities we've added are of course our stronger cities, our stronger destination and those in many cases include a significant business travel component pre-pandemic, but we're adding a lot fewer frequencies than before. So strong business markets like Panama, Bogota, for example, we're serving a few times per day, and pre-pandemic would have been seven or eight times. So So even though those are strong business markets, frequencies are way down because of that. But we have opened all those markets because they just, as mentioned before, happen to be stronger routes overall. The ones that we're going to be opening gradually from here to the end of the year and into 2022 usually have actually a high leisure and VFR component, but are just much smaller markets than the others.

"Okay, that's very helpful. And then the other question I had was, as you're thinking about getting back to profitability, How should we think about the return of capital plans? Because, you know, for a long time until the pandemic, your, your dividend was an important component of that. And obviously, with the pandemic, that's just not the case right now. So how should we think about returning capital, you know, in 20, let's say a year, a year and a half from now, and maybe things are back to some level of, you know, the next normal?","Yeah, so so we haven't changed Our dividend policy, we're just missing the profit part of it. And even though I want to talk officially, because we have to see how things develop, but I would expect that once we have the profit component, the dividend policy will kick in. We have strong liquidity. We're in a strong overall position.

"Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Ray Wong on for Duane. You had mentioned significant travel restrictions being a major indicator for demand recovery, specifically some bright spots in leisure into the U.S. Along those lines, what percent of your markets are reopened? Do any countries in your network have a vaccine requirement? And could you provide some specificity for countries that have or don't have significant travel restrictions in place?","Okay, this is Pedro here. Good morning. I don't think I have the exact percent of numbers, or numbers, but pretty much every market has some sort of travel restriction. It might be as simple as providing an antigen or PCR test X hours before travel, a negative test of course. Most countries have that restriction, a few like Mexico and Brazil don't, but the rest pretty much have it. Others have quarantine restrictions, like Chile, for example. And where we get the most affected is when countries are restricting the number of flights, like it's happening in Argentina, to the whole industry. And a few other markets are also restricting capacity. So it's hard to pinpoint, but The open markets like Brazil, Mexico, the U.S. for most origins, not for all, it's not open for Brazil as we know, but those markets, some Caribbean islands like the Dominican Republic, those markets are seeing a faster recuperation or recovery than the ones that have higher restrictions as would be expected.",829.131,914.494,1,2021,2,0.358,0.358,0,-0.0679999999999999,-0.0679999999999999,0,0.099,0.099,0,0.772,0.772,0,0.8099999999999999,0.8099999999999999,0,0.929,0.929,0

I mean, there are a number of our main competitors restructuring under Chapter 11, but we expect them to come out of Chapter 11 with a network that won't be much different to what they have before. Of course, we don't know for sure. We haven't seen the restructuring plans, but we're not expecting major shifts there, if any. And then there's new competition, of course. From new and existing carriers, they're adding capacity throughout our region, so we expect to see more competition in the future, but no major capacity shifts that I can think of. The only thing that I add to that is that the hub on the post-COVID world, the hub still carries quite a bit of uniqueness, and it has a lot of strength in terms of the smaller markets that we serve. And so, therefore, I think that we're well positioned even under the increased competitive influx of some of the low-cost carriers in the region and some of the capacity from the U.S. The reality is that the hub still competes on markets that cannot be served very well on a point-to-point basis.",943.299,1023.59,3,2021,2,0.4439999999999999,0.8589999999999998,0,-0.063,-0.1729999999999998,0,0.288,0.371,0,0.7390000000000001,1.334,0,0.891,2.408,0,0.969,2.278,0

"Good morning, gentlemen, and thanks very much for taking my question. I'm curious, you know, given what we've seen with kind of slower business travel in the Americas, I've had one or two industry contacts mention that, you know, they know of plans by specific businesses to try to launch you know, business passenger-only type services. You know, I'm wondering if you guys have even seen anything like this or if it's, you know, we're talking about, you know, paper tigers here. Just love to get your take on that.","Yeah, well, our part of the world might be different to others. The distances are shorter and not everywhere, but in many markets. In our case, we operate mainly in narrowbodies. Of course, we've seen corporate travel slow down. I would say that corporate travel in our network is about 50% of what was pre-pandemic, and it's recovering a lot slower than VFR and leisure. that in some markets is getting close to pre-pandemic. And what we've heard for a lot of our accounts is that, you know, they'll start traveling after the summer. But I'm sure that will depend on the virus also. We're not planning to make any major changes to our product to target a specific market.

You know, Panama itself, I know that Panama has been allowing in-transit passengers to pass through the airport with no problems. But for foreigners arriving in Panama, could you just remind me what kind of, if they have quarantine requirements or anything like that?","There's no requirement other than a negative test 72 hours before travel for most passengers from Europe, Latin America, and the U.S. However, certain high-risk countries, mostly from South America and a few from Europe, have to provide the negative test plus another test on arrival and then a three-day quarantine at, you know, one of the listed hotels.

Have you seen, either from afar or through conversations with your U.S. airline counterparts, about any lessons learned? that you might consider as you contemplate restarting operations, just to ensure that you don't incur some of the same issues operationally that we're seeing up here happening in the States right now?","We have, obviously we're now guiding to 70% of pre-pandemic capacity in Q3. So we've been spooling up since Q1, actually since Q4. of last year. We've been doing it gradually. However, between Q2 and Q3, we're going to be growing 50% in ASM, so it's going to be like our fastest redeployment of capacity. But we've had a few quarters to get it done correctly, and as you've seen from our on-time performance, at 92% in Q2 and even higher in Q1, we haven't lost a step in coming back with the capacity.

"Okay. Okay, thank you. And then, Jose, sorry for the modeling question, but it could be a nice little factor here. I'm kind of curious about ASMs per gallon. You had a low stage length. You're under 1,200 miles. Obviously, you got rid of the U190s. But as you think about the MAX that's coming in, the U190s, are you going to be able to keep these ASMs per gallon above 83 or take them even higher over the next two to three years?","Yeah, I think the trend, the MAX has... a fuel performance that is around 13% better than the 800 on a per ASM basis. So therefore, you know, you can certainly assume that as the MAX come into the fleet, that there will be an improvement in the ASM per gallon figure that we will be seeing over the next several months as more MAXs come in. So, yeah, the MAX right now represents almost 20% of the fleet, so it will become more and more important as time passes and more MAXs come into the fleet. And the other thing is that you have to also model it on a going-forward basis, and the fact that the E190s are gone, and that also aids in the field that we're seeing in the business.",1366.331,1421.611,8,2021,2,0.429,2.712,0,-0.074,-0.5129999999999995,0,0.479,1.741,0,0.95,3.907,0,0.924,6.297,0,0.968,6.447,0

"Hi, Pedro, Jose, Daniel. Thank you for the call. A quick question on the unitary cost. What are your expectations in terms of KSMX fuel as long as capacity continues to recover? I mean, do you believe there might be some structural savings cost savings once capacity is fully recovered, and where does these structural cost savings may come from? Thank you.","Yes, Alejandro. As you saw, first of all, we are providing our guidance for Q3 at 6.6 cents, which is getting very close to our 2019 cash demand. That's only at 70%. of our 2019 capacity. So it is getting close to the levels that we had pre-pandemic. Our expectations, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that we will achieve CASM below six cents. That is below where we were in 2019 pre-pandemic. By the time that we reach 100% of capacity. Where did that come from? First of all, last year we worked exceedingly hard in renegotiating our contracts with suppliers, with counterparties that we do business with. We have been very adamant about the fleet changes that we've made. That provides quite a bit of savings as well on a per ASM basis. And we continue on with that. We continue with our savings plans, both in terms of looking for further efficiencies in contracts, IT systems, Overhead, we are a leaner organization than what we were a year ago. It's all about that, and we are confident that as we get back to 100%, we will achieve cuts, and that will be less than six cents.",1472.403,1578.828,10,2021,2,0.471,3.204,0,-0.071,-0.6409999999999993,0,0.5619999999999999,2.274,0,0.946,4.814,0,0.935,7.689,0,0.966,7.807,0
"Okay, thank you. Just a second question, if I may. On the decision, I mean, what was the rationale behind the decision of keeping the remaining 6, 737, 700?","Yeah, Alejandro. I would say that reason number one is when we started experiencing a faster capacity recovery or demand recovery than what we expected earlier in the year. So that was number one. And number two is that those aircraft, well, first of all, they're owned and paid for, not very expensive, so the per-seat cost is equivalent to the $800. And at the same time, they have the same great reliability of the rest of the fleet. So the cost of keeping those aircraft, even if it was as insurance, is nothing. And the cost of being short aircraft could be very high. So we're just hedging our bets.

"Hey, good morning. On your revenue guidance, you know, it implies a significant kind of yield compression in 3Q compared to 2Q, given that your year-over-two-year capacity is kind of improving by 22 points on a sequential basis, but your revenue is not improving. It's improving on about 13 points. Is that just a function of you're bringing back a lot of capacity and you're just seeing more leisure yields? You know, because we are moving from kind of the seasonally weak 2Q to 3Q, so I was wondering why that was.","Yeah, Xavi, so this was said here. Indeed, you very well hit it in the head there. We are adding 50% of capacity Q3 versus Q2, as Pedro alluded to earlier. Traffic is in that same line. So it is indeed yields. We are seeing that with a rampable capacity, there is a gap simply to... allow ourselves to grow. What I would say is that this is not about a quarter. It's about rebuilding the hub. And we believe that the ramp up of the hub and maintaining its frequency and destinations is very important in sort of the future development of it. So it is sort of like a transitional quarter, but we are seeing that indeed there is a yield reduction on a percent basis, especially during the latter part of the quarter, especially during the latter part of the quarter. And you know what? We'll make adjustments to the capacity if required.

"Makes sense. And the... You addressed this a little bit, I think, Pedro, earlier when talking about competition, but I was wondering just one on Volaris. You know, they've talked about expanding to northern South America in the medium term and deploying like 18 to 22 aircraft there, either from Mexico, Costa Rica, or El Salvador. Just wondering you talked about the small markets that you serve maybe that's the answer here but just you know how and what and what to what extent will copa be able to defend against you know potential uh excursions from valaris into your market yeah well yeah savvy pedro here and and you know you you provided part of the answer and we you know we have many competitors and we've seen growth since the pandemic started","from both legacy earnings from the U.S., LCCs from the U.S., from Latin America, et cetera. So that's not new. The news are kind of been repeating for the past few months. We're focusing on what makes us successful, which is one is keeping our costs as low as possible. As Jose mentioned, we're planning to come out of the pandemic. Hopefully the pandemic ends one day. But we're hoping that when we are back at 100%, we're going to be at below $0.06 a KASM. And we're going to be at pre-pandemic KASM when we reach 80%, which that should not be... too far from now. We're also connecting small markets. The strength of our hub is that we connect over 70% of our markets. Our markets are too small to be able to be served non-stop directly. That's not going to change after the pandemic, at least not for a while. And it's also hard to stimulate traffic in many markets in Latin America, not only because of the size of the market, but because of how high the airport fees and taxes are. So before you start charging a penny, the passenger has to pay quite a large amount of money. So it's hard to stimulate new traffic with those kind of We also have – we're part of a strong alliance with United and Star Alliance.

"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of a follow-up on the first question. If you were to estimate how capacity recovery was among leisure and BFR, what would it be your best guess? And kind of a related question to that one, to what extent do you think that vaccination tourism helped demand over the quarter? Thank you.","I will start by saying, Pablo, that what we're seeing right now in terms of the breakdown of the type of demand that we have is that, yeah, it's being driven by VFR. I would say that VFR is almost half of the traffic that we're seeing. I'm sorry, leisure is about half, a little bit less than half in leisure, and followed by VFR about a third. And then as Pedro mentioned before, business travel is down, I want to say, half versus where it was before the pandemic. So it now represents maybe 15% to 20% of our total traffic. That's the breakdown that we are seeing right now. But of course, again, the pandemic has taught us that things change over time. So this is the picture that we have as of today. And in terms of vaccine tourism to the U.S., it's obviously impossible for us to know the reasons people travel for. But there was an increase in two from the U.S. traffic sometimes towards the end of April. when vaccines were kind of openly available in the U.S. So that obviously led us to believe that one thing is tied to the other. And we're seeing a slowdown right now. You know, as more vaccines are available in Latin American countries and as people get vaccinated, you know, there's an initial rush and we expect that to continue slowing down. But as you know, we have a very strong network that's not dependent on one particular market or one particular sector. So we'll keep on rebuilding our network and leveraging those strengths.

"Hey, good morning, and thanks for the time. Good morning. As a follow-up to Hunter's question, what is your current upper limit on capacity? If all countries reopened today, restrictions fully removed, what percent of your 2019 capacity could you fly? And how should we think about your capacity over the next few quarters if things remain as they are today? Clearly, I know you're not giving a guide beyond 3Q, but if we were to assume that nothing changed, is it fair to say that you would continue to add capacity from here? Thanks.","Yeah, so Pedro here. If we compare to pre-pandemic, let's say to 2019, we were, by the end of 2019, we were operating 96 aircraft. We had 102, but that included 6, max 9, which were not operating, were grounded, as we know. So in 2019, by the end of 2019, we operated 96 as COPPA holdings. By the end of 2021, we'll have 89 as COPPA holdings. We might still have a few in the desert, which we have to reactivate, but that can happen in the first part of 2022. And then we have five max nine deliveries in 2022. So that's going to take us to, you know, we also have lease returns, which we have to decide how many we're going to return or not. We're guiding now that we will renew some of those leases. And then our aircraft are of higher gauge because we've sold the Embraer 190s. So we're operating mostly 800 NGs and max 9, so much higher gauge than the Embraers. So shortly, sometime, right now, we will not be at 100%, but we can be in the high 80s by the end of this year. And sometime towards the second half of 2022, we could be close to the 100% in ASMs. And in terms of costs, Bert, you know, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter, but if we are in, you know, if demand trends sort of go on in the way that we expect them to, you know, our unit costs for the fourth quarter could be in the low six cent range.",2138.199,2266.314,17,2021,2,0.396,5.574999999999999,0,-0.072,-1.094999999999999,0,0.154,3.36,0,0.951,9.005,0,0.888,12.976,0,0.966,13.67,0
"Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. Maybe just along the same vein, Can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about your fleet longer term? I wish I could find this, but you had a good chart in one of your investor presentations that sort of showed two lines, one going up and down, and just sort of highlighted your fleet flexibility, which has clearly been a nice lever to be able to pull during the pandemic. You know, demand seems to be proving pretty resilient. Are you starting to refocus maybe on your longer-term growth? Thanks again for the questions.","Yes. So we're still cautious. Because, you know, it's something we've learned is that this virus is unpredictable. And even the people that know don't really know that much until it happens. So we've been very cautious, but at the same time we've been reactivating our aircraft, bringing them back from the desert at a much faster pace than what we expected earlier in the year. And, you know, we're even talking to Boeing right now to see if we can move forward some MAX 9 deliveries. So we're in those discussions right now and we have the flexibility of over 20 LEED NGs coming due in the next three to four years. So that gives us, we could bring forward MAC-9s, we could renew NGs or return NGs. We're going to retain a lot of flexibility in the next three years. and we hope to have enough capacity to grow above the ASM levels we had in pre-pandemic.

"Yeah. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions here. So first question really ties to the vaccine rollout across your network, the countries you serve versus the expectation for business travel to recover. So I think every country has got a different vaccine rollout, of course. If you were to take some kind of average of the various rollouts, I'm just wondering what that expectation for when your markets would be fully vaccinated is that you know, early 2022, you know, Brazil by year-end, but for the whole network, early 2022, or is it end of 2022, or does it really tie to an earlier question, you know, sometime mid-next year? And then related to that vaccine rollout, you know, what is the expectation? Does business travel recover ahead of that rollout, or is it, you know, coincide with it or lag it? You know, what can you share along those lines? So...","I'll take the first shot at it and then I'll let Jose back me up. In Panama, for example, we think that by the month of September, so a month from now, anyone that wants a vaccine will have access to a vaccine. We are about 80%, I'm sorry, 40% vaccinated right now, but the vaccines are coming in at a very fast pace on a weekly basis And I think in a month, anyone that wants to get vaccinated will be able to get vaccinated. It seems to be going that way also in Colombia from what we know. And it's just gaining steam in most countries in Latin America. So I would hope that by the end of the year, so by the end of the fourth quarter, the countries will be vaccinated to the degree that the population wants to get vaccinated. And in terms of corporate travel coming back, so we've heard from some of the major accounts that they'll start traveling after the summer, but we know that it won't be at the same rate than before, in the same percentage as pre-pandemic. Also, Latin America is made up of a lot of small companies and regional multi-Latin American companies, and I think those are going to start traveling soon. probably sooner than the larger international or U.S. corporations. But we cannot really predict exactly how that's going to play out. Yeah, I just add, Dan, that the business traveler that travels on COPPA, there's a big component there of small business owners or people who work for very small companies. And we believe, as Pedro mentioned, that those folks will get back in the air in a shorter term than sort of the big corporate accounts.",2424.446,2545.829,19,2021,2,0.407,6.433,0,-0.0579999999999999,-1.227999999999999,0,0.47,4.38,0,0.949,10.068,0,0.874,14.641,0,0.962,15.478,0
"Yeah, that makes sense. So that ties to, I guess, my second question here, and it's really kind of a two-pronged question. It kind of gets back to, I think, an earlier question, Savi, just on the yield expectation for the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you can You know, help us understand what really happened in the second quarter. Were yields initially weaker and then stronger towards the end? And, you know, how does that tie to the third quarter? I mean, if corporate travel comes back, it sounds like that might not be embedded into the third quarter revenue outlook. And then, you know, kind of related to that, are there any countries in Latin America looking to Europe as a model for how to open, so requiring a vaccine passport potentially as a way to bypass testing and quarantines?","Yeah, I would say for the third quarter, first of all, the news story in the second quarter was... I think it was mostly towards the latter part of the second quarter, more than in the beginning. And it, I think, was... As a function of several items, there was, as Pedro mentioned before, there was some vaccine tourism to the U.S., but also there was, I think, an opening of certain countries started to open, especially in the Caribbean and in Mexico. So that created, I think, that bump in demand that we saw. And it was mostly, again, during the latter part of the second quarter. And what we're seeing right now is that in the third quarter specifically, the latter part of the third quarter is where we're seeing that there is a little bit of a yuga. But the important thing here, however, is also that we're putting in quite a bit of additional capacity into the third quarter. So I think it's not necessarily a story of weakness, but rather the fact that we are adding capacity into a network in order to build the network back. And I think that's the story related to what we're seeing in the third quarter right now.",2590.843,2665.477,20,2021,2,0.397,6.83,0,-0.06,-1.287999999999999,0,0.223,4.603,0,0.849,10.917,0,0.868,15.509,0,0.952,16.43,0

"Oh, hey. Hey, everybody. Hey, Pedro, in your response to Alejandro's question earlier about holding on to the 6737-700s, you gave two reasons. And I actually thought that maybe a third reason was that maybe you recognize the importance of having some smaller gauge airplanes around. You know, I think you had mentioned the strength of of the Panama hub and the reliance on small markets. And I'm just curious, but it sounds like that wasn't a consideration. Or you may be actually potentially looking down the road at maybe a smaller gauge airplane. Just thoughts on that?","So it's an interesting question. It was not a consideration. However, the 6700s are going to fly a network aircraft made up of the smaller, the thinner routes. So those aircraft that are going to operate were before we had exclusively E-190s operating.

You know, you're flying Miami, Panama or Panama, Miami. I think you're doing now nine round trips, which pre-COVID, I can't even think that, I mean, I think around the holidays you got to nine round trips.

And I'm not telling you to go buy an A350 or a 787, but would you consider max nines number one number two tied to that is a lot you know you hear ayat talk about a lot of broken itineraries and i think when i look throughout south america latin america there's been a significant pull down in service um namely by some of the carriers that are going through restructuring we've seen a lot of itineraries that have completely disappeared and it does seem like that copa is in a very good position to maintain those itineraries, maybe not on a nonstop basis, but on a one-stop basis over Panama. And I'm just curious if you're picking up some of that share, because again, I, I almost thought I had to do a double take to see how much frequency that you're running between Miami and Panama now. And I suspect that that's not everybody who wants to go to Miami or Panama city. You're taking a lot of passengers into South America because the service isn't there because of the pandemic. So sort of a two prong question about the seven, three, seven max 10 and, and or share that you may have picked up in the meantime because of the struggles of competitors in your region. Thank you for answering the questions.","Yeah, so Mike, a lot of stuff in your question.",2889.67,2896.455,23,2021,2,0.426,7.864,0,-0.064,-1.4779999999999989,0,0.1399999999999999,4.965,0,0.902,11.399,0,0.726,17.705,0,0.963,19.068,0
I'm sorry.,"As always. When we think of larger gauge aircraft, and as we said in the past, and you know us well, we try to keep things as simple as possible so we can have a simple single fleet as much as possible. Right now we are a 737 operator, exclusively 737, mainly NG-800s and MAXs. MAX 9 is very simple. There's pilot commonalities, the whole thing. And sometimes we sacrifice having the ideal aircraft or the ideal gauge in a few markets in exchange for having the better fleet for the whole network. And we're going to keep that mentality. And if the MAX 10 is something we're going to bring in, it needs to make sense in more than just one route, more than just Miami, etc. We would rather run wingtips in some markets, knowing that that facilitates the having a single, narrow body, very efficient fleet. So that's kind of what we're weighing out always. commonality, simplicity versus the ideal aircraft for each market, which is hard to do. And that's also going to drive any future decision about a smaller gauge aircraft, which was your first question. That same philosophy is going to drive that. In terms of the broken itineraries, we're in a recovery mode ourselves, so we're rebuilding our network. and our six-band connectivity, which started late in June. So we'll take advantage of any opportunities that fit that single hub model, but we are in that recovery mode, so I cannot say that we're taking full advantage of everything. Plus, we know that a lot of that service will be covered when some of the other carriers come out of their own restructuring. So we also want to be rational about that.",2898.197,3041.579,24,2021,2,0.516,8.379999999999999,0,-0.072,-1.549999999999999,0,0.2449999999999999,5.209999999999999,0,0.914,12.313,0,0.867,18.572,0,0.972,20.04,0

And just along those lines, I was wondering, you know, if we can start thinking about maybe sub-$0.08 as you get to 2019 capacity and, you know, what some of the tailwinds and headwinds that you might see over the next two years. You know, for example, I'm guessing, performance bonuses will start up again next year if, you know, if the current trends hold.

Yeah, our expectation as of now is that when we reach that 90% of 2019 capacity that we will be below the $0.06 mark. So, yeah. And, you know, in terms of What are some of the tailwinds that we have? I mean, we have a lot of projects ongoing. I'll go back to the fleet itself, you know, in terms of the uniformity in the fleet, and as we put in additional maximum, it will be a good improvement. I think that there's, you know, always... contract renegotiations and savings that we've performed that I think we'll, I think we shed a lot, quite a bit over the last several months in terms of our overall costs. And so, yeah, we'll, you know, there's more there. There certainly, we're working on this every day. And, you know, there's an opportunity, I think, for we grow to bring it probably in further uh down but at this stage we'll reserve that to 2022 when we get closer to the figure and we'll uh you know but i think we're in we're in good track to bring it down below six cents and below there uh as you mentioned and and savvy you you're right there will be expenses that maybe we haven't had to the same level during the pandemic like performance bonuses but those are always based on surpassing our targets and on much better performance and results.

Congratulations on being flat to 2019 on slightly less than 70% capacity, which obviously underscores the operating leverage tail end of your story. Where did you make up, like, what were the positive surprises on the cost side, and are these timing benefits that maybe dissipate, you know, over the next couple quarters, or are these things more permanent? Can you just run through, because it was a pretty sizable cost piece.","Absolutely, Mike. Yeah, and I have to start by saying that we've been in this company-wide effort to keep our costs down. That's always been part of the Copa DNA, but we improved on that over the past year and a half. I would say specifically for Q3... There were a set of restart-related expenses that actually came in lower than what we thought. So you could argue it was a little bit of timing, and we thought that there were some expenses that were going to be somewhat higher than what we thought initially. And looking forward, you know, we gave a guide now for Q4 of 6.1 cents.

"Okay, great. And then just my second question, and this is probably Jose or Pedro. You know, now that you have 13 737 MAX 9s and, you know, the fact that, like, you're going to get two more and then another seven, so it's going to become a much bigger part of your fleet, it does have a product that historically – that is very unique to COPA from a historical perspective. And I'm getting at the fact that you have the lie-flat seat, which, you know, when you think about all the service that has been withdrawn in the region – even connecting over Panama, if you can, say, fly from San Fran to Sao Paulo and lie flat to a lie flat. I haven't asked this question in previous quarters because I didn't think you had enough shells to really give a good answer, but when we think about the uptake in the premium cabin, what are you seeing? You know, are you getting better pricing? Are you at or, you know, levels similar to maybe some of the U.S. competitors? Is the pricing... you know, on par with some of the nonstop service because this is your flagship product, and I feel like you can really roll this out and take advantage of those who are willing to pay up for it. So any color that you can provide on that product because I think it's a fantastic product.","Yeah, thank you, Michael. A few comments. So we need to have enough shelves, as you well said. to guarantee the service on a given market. So, for example, a San Francisco and a Sao Paulo will have a guaranteed DREAMS, as we call our product, guaranteed DREAMS service. So once it's guaranteed, we can price it better consistently. And so far, we've been getting a premium for the DREAMS product. And also, I should say, that our costs are better than options through other hubs or nonstop options when they are. They're usually not that many.

"Hi, Pedro. Hi, Jose, Daniel. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a question on yields. What can we expect for 2022? I mean, considering that on one side you are expecting a further significant progress in capacity, and this could push yields lower, but also the business traffic hasn't recovered, and this could help to have a better yields environment. So any thoughts or color around this may be useful.","Yeah, Alejandro, so, you know, it's too early. We haven't provided full-year guidance for 2022, but I would say that system-wide, The yield environment has been improving, and as we put in capacity, there's – but I would say that at least initially for the first part of the year, it could be offers in the 2019 base in the kind of mid-single-digit range. So that's kind of the first kind of look into the early part of 2022 in terms of the yield compared to 2019.

"Okay, sure. So just on restart, right, can you give us some examples of, like, what's ahead of you, you know, kind of what you're considering? Are there any pockets where, you know, labor availability is, you know, more strained or, you know, You know, and maybe you could just kind of qualitatively talk about, you know, pilots, for example.","Yeah, okay. So, you know, your first comment, you know, I had to like pause and think about it. And I should say that we're not trying to stand back. Honestly, this pandemic has been very difficult to predict. and even three months ahead it's like you know two years in normal times so so the man came back at least in this quarter and what we're seeing in the next few quarters much faster and stronger than what we would have expected you know some months ago so so i think that's important to keep in mind that that times are very different in the old days we could predict things but We grew capacity quarter over quarter, 50%, and it was hard to tell then how demand was going to react. Back in November of 2020, which seems like 10 years ago, We grew capacity quite a bit from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021, and demand did not show up, not materialize, so we had to pull back. So that's kind of the things we're dealing with in this pandemic. So, you know, it's always good for demand to remain strong, and that's kind of what we're hoping or what we're seeing right now. In terms of labor, we think we're okay. We... we are about you know in the next maybe month and a half or two months we would have brought back from furlough all of our pilots we we have already brought back all of our flight attendants and we're even rehiring a flight attendant that took voluntary leave programs and after that group will start hiring new new flight attendants so in so in pilots we will soon bring back everyone that that was in furlough. We have pilots that took voluntary leave. We've contacted them, and a high percent of them is willing to come back. And we're also strengthening our own in-house pilot academy, so we're growing that also. So right now, we feel we're fine in that respect. But, again, you know, we're always cautious and always alert because this pandemic is always full of surprises. Flexibility is key in all aspects.

"Thank you very much, and congratulations on the performance. So, you know, I just have a very quick follow-up on the cost performance. You know, we saw wages, salaries down by 40% versus the third quarter of 2019. which implies that on a per ASM basis, this number here is around 13% below pre-crisis level. So considering everything that was discussed, the potential increase in bonuses and everything going forward, do you still expect for this cost line on a per ASM basis to be below pre-crisis levels on a sustainable basis or not? Thank you very much.","Yeah, our expectation is that it would remain below pre-pandemic levels. It will mostly come from overhead adjustments and operational efficiencies. As we grow ASMs and flights, we will increase overhead. But we hope that we will increase capacity by a higher percentage so we can keep that relation we have right now.

We try not to advertise our competitors, but there is action in the region, especially from either new entrants, or not new entrants, but new entrants to the region, to some of the markets, UOCC, so there's quite a bit of activity. It's a reason why we've always been so focused on our unit cost, and we always bet that having our unit cost as low as possible and below any full service carrier and very close to low cost carriers is the key to future success and that combined with our strong network which we're keeping strong and growing and everything else we do in terms of having world leading on time performance and a strong product we think that's the key to our success we have a very strong hop in the best geographic position and if we do all the other things or if we continue to do everything else correctly we should be able to succeed in the future even under new competition which is something that we've always had to deal with thank you and congratulations again thank you thank you",1825.345,1909.683,14,2021,3,0.496,5.001,0,-0.07,-0.9439999999999998,0,0.349,4.268,0,0.501,6.196,0,0.883,10.752,0,0.956,12.033,0
"Hi, Pedro Pepe. Thanks for taking my question. I have kind of a follow-up question on the revenue side. I am very curious to learn what type of passengers or the demand segment is driving such strong performance It is still leisure-driven. It's perhaps vaccine tourism or corporate is coming back quicker than expected. What is driving this result? And also going forward, do you think that, for example, if you're thinking about leisure, how leisure would look like when we return to normalcy perhaps in the first half of next year? Thank you.","Yeah, Pablo. I would say that the big drivers are leisure and VFR traffic, more so than business. Before the pandemic, you could argue that our breakdown of traffic for us was about a third each segment, and as of now, there's probably more of a 40% leisure 40% VFR and about 20% business. So their business is off versus where it was before. But it isn't vaccine tourism anymore. Vaccine tourism, at least in our region, occurred, I want to say, back in the second quarter. Today, it's more just real leisure of people wanting to to go on a vacation after being locked up for a long period of time.

"Great. Good day, everyone, and thanks for the call. I had a follow-up on the issue of competition and wanted to ask if you could comment on how much your yields have been helped by either U.S. carriers or regional ones bringing capacity back at a slower pace than you guys on overlapping routes. And then a related one is also I believe that Avianca's new CEO made comments in the press recently that their line is shifting to a point-to-point strategy and just wanted to hear your views on the relevance of that announcement for COPPA.","Yes, so they have announced. I mean, U.S. carriers have brought back capacity to a higher level than pre-pandemic. So most, if not all, U.S. carriers are offering more ASMs now than what they offered in 2019. I'm talking in Latin America. Some of the major hub and spoke carriers that went or are going through Chapter 11 procedures, so they are below, but then everyone else is above 2019. So it's a mixture there. Yes, Avianca, as you well mentioned, made declarations, and I think they even kind of published their Chapter 11 exit plan or something, and it's going to be more of a low-cost strategy with densified planes, point-to-point service, and lower yields. So, yes, we've heard that, and we're confident that we will be able to maintain our cost advantage and be able to compete under any scenario, and we are prepared for that, and we're preparing further for that kind of competitive environment.",2114.45,2199.041,17,2021,3,0.484,6.18,0,-0.0729999999999999,-1.1389999999999998,0,0.391,5.498,0,0.7030000000000001,7.245,0,0.909,13.296,0,0.961,14.799,0

What we're seeing is that people want to fly and travel like they did before the pandemic, and in a way it's been surprising to the degree that this is going on. We are not seeing the fear of traveling that we expected maybe a year ago or nine months ago. And I think it's just regular demand.

"Okay, very helpful, Pedro. And as my follow-up, just very quickly, appreciate the color on 2022. Any high-level view for next year? You know, how many flight banks you guys might be running out of document, or it's still too early to say?","Well, we run six flight banks, and I don't think that's going to change. We've been doing it for a while. We're still not all the way – back to the number of flights we had a pre pandemic we still have to restart a number of destinations and that will happen throughout the year 2022 so i think 2022 is a year where we need to get back to what we were in 20 in 2019 in terms of the the size of the hub, the connectivity, the number of flights. So that's kind of what we'll be doing most of the year. And always looking for new opportunities from the hub as well.

"Oh, hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. You know, just following up on that last question on pent-up demand, I think the rule of thumb historically in Latin America has been, you know, two times GDP. And, you know, are you thinking that once things normalize, it might still be two times or could pent-up demand drive it something higher to like, say, three times or even higher than three times?","Well, I think it's early to say where it will wind up. But I think if you look at the macroeconomic factors, the economies are at a particular level where, yes, I think their travel demand will grow eventually at two to three times GDP growth. I think that level where the Latin American economies are still maintains itself after COVID. And so... So, yes, in the longer term, I think that I believe that that's going to be the case.

"Yeah, and that actually gets to my next question here, and it just sort of ties to operations for the current quarter and and how you've been managing operations over the pandemic. And with respect to the current quarter, I'm just wondering how the network plans have evolved. So I'm looking at Brazil. I'm seeing some cuts to Brazil, for example. So it looks like you're managing flights based on demand, trimming when you need to, adding where you can. And so, again, it doesn't look like it's new to the quarter, but where I'm going with this is do the changes weigh on profitability, or do they actually help with profitability?","I would say that we're looking at it very carefully, almost constantly. But I think that we are always looking for the opportunities to improve on our profitability. building back the network. I think that the key factor here is ensuring that we build a network as quickly and as effectively as we can to get to a point where the capacity of the network is as close to where it was prior to the pandemic. That's, I think, the driving factor that we're looking at. And then what you're saying, which is true, It's also a result of what I was saying earlier about the difficulty in predicting what's ahead during this time. So we've had to make more changes and adjustments along the way that we're used to. Hopefully, in the next few quarters, we'll be able to have a more predictable and stable operation and just stick to it.",2481.937,2557.183,21,2021,3,0.4589999999999999,7.870999999999999,0,-0.063,-1.3989999999999996,0,0.176,6.595,1,0.7110000000000001,10.121,0,0.82,16.503,0,0.97,18.555,0

And I guess, you know, if you're not really selling it as a flagship product, you know, what is the timeframe for when you might feel like you're ready to go live with that?","No, we do sell it. We do sell it for a premium when we can guarantee it in every flight in a given market. So there's a few markets where we can already do that. It all depends on the number of shells we're operating. So as we get more MAX 9, we add the number of markets. Right now it's probably... Somewhere around five markets, I think. Yes, like four or five markets where we guarantee the Dreams product.

"Hey, good morning, everyone. Just on 1Q outlook, you know, given Easter is not until mid-April and kind of January, I believe, is the seasonally strongest month in 1Q, is it fair to say that you have fairly good visibility into the quarter, or are there, you know, some of those assumptions incorrect, or perhaps the booking behavior is so different today that maybe kind of March kind of matters a lot more to the quarter than it has historically.","Hi, Sabi. Pedro here. So, yes, I mean, all booking patterns are very different to what we were used to in normal times pre-pandemic. But what we've seen so far, but so far means the last two weeks, is bookings coming back. to quote unquote a normal level or a normal meaning what we were seeing pre-Omicron. So, but again, that's just a few weeks. And what we've learned from this pandemic is that things change from one day to the other.

"Makes sense. And then if I might ask, on the MAX fleet, just one, you know, when do you start to, you know, when do you expect to start getting MAX 10s into your fleet?

Are you getting the 174-seat configuration now so you get a little bit more gauge benefit here?","Yes, you're correct. The last two MAX 9s, if I'm not mistaken, have come with the 174 configuration, and so will the rest of the MAX 9s we still have to receive. And we will decide in the future. We haven't made that decision yet. If the ones that are under a 166 configuration will also change to 174, which it takes very little effort. But that decision has not been made yet. In terms of the MAC-10s? Yeah, I think that the MAC-10s are not yet in the pipeline for this year and next, so it's still some time left until we start to receive them. And again, I want to highlight also, Sally, that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of the subtypes that we have within the order, so we can switch them from 10s into other of the subtypes as well.

Our next question comes from Stephen Trent of Citi. Your line is open.,"Good morning, gentlemen, and many thanks for taking my question. Kind of two very quick ones for you. The first, am I correct in thinking that you guys are probably not under significant pressure in terms of your pilot pipeline, just thinking about the more significant dislocation among the Latin Airlines versus the U.S., and considering maybe there's some pilots out there looking for work. Just sort of wanted a high-level understanding how you guys are seeing your pilot supply. Right. So short-term, we are okay. We have still pilots that took voluntary leave during the pandemic that we can bring back. We activated every pilot that was on furlough. but we still have the voluntary leaves we can bring back. We also have an interesting pipeline from our own flight academy, and we're going to have, at the end of the year, about 100 pilots there that we will incorporate into the airline. So we're thinking it's more medium-term, and we think that we're taking the necessary steps to be fine also medium-term and beyond. Okay, great color, Pedro. I definitely appreciate that. And just one other quick one for me. I was intrigued by what you guys mentioned about converting one of your 737-8s into a freighter. Is this something that you might consider doing with other 737-8s, or do you kind of see it as a one-off? You know, that should kind of be a narrative medium term thing as the pandemic winds down. Right. So a few things there. First is that we made that decision when we had our aircraft in the desert. We're not flying and cargo was booming worldwide and in the region. And in hindsight, it was the right decision. And we expect that aircraft to produce on a single airplane basis better profits than our last passenger or less profitable passenger aircraft. So it was a good decision and we have an option for a second conversion in the coming years and also these are our oldest non-Boeing Sky Interior 800s. The other thing I would add is that we charter We're already chartering. We've been chartering for a while freighter aircraft that fly regionally. Many of the hours are going to be replacement. Our own freighter, a much more efficient 800 freighter, is going to replace a less efficient 727 freighter we charter for regional flying, and then we'll add hours to that. So we're really happy with the decision. It's not turning us into a big-time freighter carrier. It's more of a niche opportunity, but I think it complements well the rest of our business. Okay, definitely appreciate that, Pedro. I'll let someone else ask their question.",1100.141,1314.909,3,2021,4,0.4569999999999999,1.1769999999999998,0,-0.0579999999999999,-0.1789999999999998,0,0.575,0.6209999999999999,0,0.934,2.414,0,0.91,2.538,0,0.972,2.901,0
"Hi, Pedro, Jose, Daniel. Thank you for the call. A quick question on the Sub-6 plan. So back in the investor day in 2019, You guided KSM-XPO below $0.06 for 2021 onwards.

"Yeah, so the KSM, the current KSM XTO, how do you think that would look like without COVID effects?","Without the COVID effects? I think that the principal component of our CASM reduction that we've seen so far is related to the fleet movements that we've made. We've moved away from the U-190 fleet, which was part of our initial assessment in terms of how to move into a sub-6 CASM. I would say that Again, we are ahead of the plan in the sense that what we published back in 2019 assumed a larger COPPA, so a lot of the benefits that we're going to get in terms of size and size of the company were going to flow down into a KASM figure. we are achieving that in a smaller COPPA. So, we're achieving the subseq chasm, we're saying at 93% of pre-COVID capacity. So it is actually ahead of that. And I would say that some of the items that we've had in terms of overhead that we've reduced probably are on the margin. I don't think it's necessarily that material in terms of where the castle will be. Maybe the castle will be just above six. But that certainly has made a difference, the fact that we have actually accelerated some of the fleet moves that we've made. been very effective in renegotiating a lot of contracts and also worked a lot in terms of overhead. So that's kind of what's gotten us faster into the sub-six target that we had.",1379.484,1482.481,5,2021,4,0.4679999999999999,1.814,0,-0.0679999999999999,-0.3059999999999997,0,0.454,1.1149999999999998,0,0.957,3.249,0,0.881,4.101,0,0.972,4.807,0
"All right, got it. And then on the unitary revenue, the guidance for the first quarter 2022 shows some implicit reduction relative to the fourth quarter 2021. So would you say that it's fully explained by Omicron and how can we think about yields for the remaining year?","Yeah, I'll start by talking about Q1 and indeed it is related to Omicron in terms of the revenue figures. I would say that it is solely related to Omicron. There's two components to Omicron. One is cancellations that we had, which reduce our revenue figures. It might not necessarily affect as much on a P&L basis because it's resulting in cancellations. And then the other portion of it is just a pure sort of softening during the month of January and February related to how we're seeing demand. So that's on the top line. But I think that when you match this to profitability for Q1 and kind of what our guidance is for Q1, the range that we have for an operating margin, there is also the impact of fuel in there. We have fuel that is 15% higher on our cost basis versus what we had in Q4. So that's another component of it. I would say, I mean, kind of deconstructing a little bit sort of the operating margin between Q4 and Q1, that about two-thirds of the reduction in margin that we're seeing quarter over quarter is related to the Omicron sort of impact and about a third related to fuel. As to the rest of the year, you know, I think it's too early to make an assessment for the rest of the year. I mean, we, I think, are confident in terms of what we're seeing in terms of capacity going forward, but I think there's still a lot of a lot of water to flow on the bridge in terms of going to put an assessment just whether revenues are going to be for the rest of the year.",1509.41,1612.604,6,2021,4,0.348,2.1619999999999995,0,-0.066,-0.3719999999999998,1,0.0799999999999999,1.1949999999999998,0,0.97,4.219,0,0.891,4.992,0,0.968,5.775,0

Is there an opportunity to do better there and improve? sort of why those two costs have diverged. I'd be curious about that. Thanks.","Yeah, there's a couple items there. First of all, yeah, our onboard costs have been lower related to just moves that we've made in terms of our onboard product, not necessarily driven by business travel, more than just simply sort of COVID-type decisions that we've made in terms of onboard product. By the way, we always listen to what our customers say as well. So it's something that we pay attention to in terms of what our customers' feedback is.

There are a few countries that still have travel restrictions, even though in most cases any significant restriction has been lifted. But I would not say that there's a one significant destination or country that we should highlight. It's very well spread out. The behavior of the demand trends seem to be uniform in general.

Anyway, Pedro, I want to go back to in previous periods, over the years since you guys have been a public company, one of the things that I always thought that you stood out versus other carriers, whether around the region or the world, was your ability to recapture higher fuel prices in your fare structure. Historically, You've done a pretty good job, and I can even recall you saying, you know, look, you know, we were able to get 100%. And I know there's a lag, and maybe that lag is, you know, three months, five months. And I don't know if it's because you fly 99% of your services international, right? So there are fuel surcharges. You do get that benefit. And you also fly to a lot of countries that, you know, where their economies actually tend to do well. when commodity prices are rising. And that's what we're seeing around the world right now. Just look at the Brazilian stock market. It's up pretty meaningfully. So I don't know, do you feel like that your business and the competition and the backdrop that you can say that you'll be able to recapture 100%? And I'm just curious, in the March quarter, underlying your 3% to 6% operating margin guide, what's your assumption? Are you assuming maybe you recapture 100%? 50% of the run-up in fuel, 75%? Is there some percentage that you can give us? So I realize it's kind of a long and sort of comprehensive type question, but, you know, it obviously matters a lot to your P&L in the March quarter and where you think you could be for the year.","Right. So staying in the 727 old-timers category, the 100% recapture comment, was actually in 2007 or 2008, if I'm not mistaken, which was the last time, actually, that Phil went through the roof. Maybe not the last time, but when it kind of got the worst. The reason, and I'll let Jose kind of round off what I'm saying, the reason we're not expecting or banking on recapturing the increase in fuel price is just all the uncertainty related to the virus and how we're bringing back capacity and how competition is less predictable. The traffic flows, it's more leisure, less business, so also harder to change prices in some markets from one day to the other. So it's just the whole business environment It's very different right now. And I know the waters will settle and things will normalize as the year progresses, but we don't want to make any bets right now or any promises. Our PRM team, as always, will do its best to recapture as much as we can, hopefully all. But it will take longer, I think, than before. No, I would just add that the other component there is currencies in the region, and the currency environment in Latin America is still not as predictable maybe as it would have been in other times. So that's another component of this, right, in terms of purchasing power. And I have to second what Pedro mentioned in terms of our – pricing and revenue management practice, which is world class and they're excellent at what they do and they capture as much as they can from every ASM that we sell. So it's very important. And then the other thing, however, I think that the other aspect that has changed or that we are really focusing on is our own controllable costs and so our our chasm x today is much lower than where it was back in 07 and and that's another big component of our ultimate profitability that we're that we're striving for okay okay great then just one quick follow-up um um since you sort of said you know that obviously given the current backdrop you know obviously a lot more discretionary than say corporate but",2213.925,2388.193,16,2021,4,0.451,4.98,0,-0.062,-1.0329999999999997,0,0.161,2.09,0,0.954,6.905,0,0.7430000000000001,12.104,0,0.97,14.47,0

Any color on that front, just given the leverage that you guys have to that side of the business.","I'll let Jose look for more specific information, but we haven't seen much change from the last few quarters. We're still doing something like 40% leisure, 40% VFR, and 20% business. It used to be a third each before the pandemic, but... But also, you know, there are other favorable trends, which is we have better load factors in business class for whatever reason, including probably the pandemic being a reason that we're selling better business class than before. So that's a positive trend. Yeah, no, no, that's it.

"Yeah, hi, gentlemen. Congratulations on this strong quarter. So, first, I'd like to address your expectations for yields when the market normalizes. What I mean is when, you know, all the grounded aircraft are back to fly and international demand normalizes, do you expect yields to be above 99 level and by how much? I know it's... very difficult question, especially regarding timing. But I think only some kind of, you know, best guess here would be very appreciated. And I'll do my second question later.","Yeah. First of all, we are too early to determine where things ultimately are going to end up. You know, we're... At least in 2022, we're just keeping it in terms of our revenue guidance for the first quarter. But I would say that the way that we're preparing for any sort of yield environment that might occur with increased competition or other type of situations with our costs, we have, again, our sub-six chasm situation. AAX is stronger than where we were pre-pandemic, and that's the way that we will compete. And by the way, we also believe, of course, that the network and the hub in Panama is the best strategy for serving the passengers in our region as well.",2541.643,2597.103,20,2021,4,0.443,6.026999999999999,0,-0.071,-1.2939999999999996,0,0.568,3.0729999999999995,0,0.319,7.604,0,0.889,14.936,0,0.971,17.818,0
"Okay, sounds good. And what about capacity deployment in the region? Because we saw COPPA's market share in the major countries, you know, doubling since pre-COVID. Basically, do you expect a lot of capacity to be still deployed in upcoming quarters? And when should this movement end? You know, when should we be more confident that yields are going to likely increase with demand normalizing. So any color on capacity deployment and how much aircraft is still grounded from competitors would be great.","Right. So I would say that capacity market share has been a little bit all over the place in Latin America. Some airlines have... deployed capacity faster than others. I mean, there's some that are above pre-pandemic capacity and others are, you know, still behind. We are like in the middle. We're very close. And by the second half of this year, we will be at a pre-pandemic capacity. So again, some are above some of the U.S. carriers, even some carriers in our region are above, and some of the main airlines that went through the Chapter 11 process are a little bit behind. And all of that alters the market share numbers too. So again, I think we stayed like in the middle, and we're following our course. We are focusing on our network, on what makes sense to us, on bringing back the capacity that we know we can fly profitably. And we expect, as mentioned, to be sometime in the second half of the year to be above 2019.

"Oh, hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. You know, hey, a few questions here. Jose, I am seeing a bigger expansion by Wingo in the current quarter. And my question is, is to what extent Wingo is going to aid or help the overall system cost story going forward? So if we were to dissect or separate out the two the two cost stories? Is it that Wingo's CASMX is sub-five, just given the higher utilization model, and then that helps to drive the sub-six CASMX story at the system level? Or is the cost story really being driven as much on the COPUS side, just given the cost restructuring you've done there?","It's both. It's both, and I would say that we're both. As you know, we don't disclose individually the two units, but both airlines or both units are doing better cost-wise. No one is sub-five, I should say, at least not yet, but that could change in the future. Good target, yes. It is a good target. And Wingo is operating more ASMs. than before the pandemic. We're a little bit less, they are a little bit more. So they're a higher percentage of the total. They're contributing a little bit more than to the overall COPPA holdings number. But again, the improvement comes from both units. Yep. Both airlines are doing much better in terms of cost than pre-pandemic.",2789.168,2848.371,22,2021,4,0.453,6.964999999999999,0,-0.0699999999999999,-1.4279999999999995,0,0.48,4.087999999999999,0,0.935,8.837,0,0.865,16.711,0,0.926,19.654,0
"Yeah, very good. And the second question that I have really is just kind of putting a finer point on some of the prior questions, and that is I'm wondering if you can just provide some perspective on the percent of overall flying, you know, say ballpark to the top five countries. And the reason I'm asking is at least when I dug into the schedules, it looks like flying in the first quarter is a bit more concentrated than it normally would be. So, you know, it looks like you're clearly making some deliberate network decisions here just to leverage some in the near term?","I would say that we're taking opportunities as they come, but it's been bouncing out more than where we were maybe Q2 of last year where there was a clear traffic going to the U.S. for vaccine tourism and the like. Now there's quite a bit in terms of leisure activities but it is, I think, more balanced than where we were last year. And then there's some countries that have opened up. That's your item here.

"Okay. Can I just squeeze one last one here? You know, I always am asking questions on pent-up demand to all the airlines. And I'm just wondering if you can speak to the COPA website searches that you're seeing for travel in March and this summer. I guess that would be winter in South America, actually, compared to 2019. So looking at searches, not bookings, I'm just wondering if you can kind of give us some perspective of what the appetite for travel is as we look ahead.","Well, we didn't bring that information.

Sorry.,"Coming up with that one question that we are not prepared to answer. So I'm going to have to give you a very, very general, but we'll get back to you. I'm going to have to give you a very general answer here, and I think what's encouraging is that we are seeing appetite for travel throughout the region, especially for leisure travel, not only to Copa markets, but to Europe, to everywhere. Skiing season in the US, some are Copa markets, some are not. to Caribbean destinations. So in general, we do not see that people are hesitant about traveling abroad. And there's still some pent-up demand, or if it's no longer pent-up, it's the urge to get out and do things and go somewhere. So in that sense, we are very, very optimistic. on the rest of the year, even though, you know, corporate demand is really hard to predict right now for many reasons. But what we see in general is people are willing and want to travel. And if something like you had a plan in January couldn't occur because of Omicron, we're seeing people say, okay, I'm going to go in on Easter weekend and, you know, that sort of thing. So it's not like people are somehow cancel and it's just simply they're postponing their travel. And that's a good point also because the booking curve has shortened. So for all the reasons we know with the virus and travel restrictions and the like, there's more people making their travel plan a lot closer to the traveling date.",2972.852,3088.298,25,2021,4,0.47,7.982999999999999,0,-0.0689999999999999,-1.6309999999999991,0,0.609,5.172999999999999,0,0.519,9.883,0,0.875,18.996,0,0.843,22.266,0
