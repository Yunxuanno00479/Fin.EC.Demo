Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? Then I have a follow-up for Tim.,"Yes, Katie. So, yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously we had very strong leverage from higher sales, and the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services. And that was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we launched many new products during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. But so in total was very good. From the FX standpoint, really at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role, neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter. partially because of the hedges, as you talked about, but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar. They're still weaker than a year ago. Look specifically to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on. Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.",1938.375,2023.01,1,2021,1,0.4409999999999999,0.4409999999999999,0,-0.0699999999999999,-0.0699999999999999,0,0.4630000000000001,0.4630000000000001,0,0.946,0.946,0,0.911,0.911,0,0.955,0.955,0
"That's great. And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just the limited visibility that investors have into the roadmap and any new categories that you might enter over time. without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity. Can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?","Thanks, Katie, for the question. And thanks for not asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around We ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves. And that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in, unless it's an adjacency product of which we're looking at it very much from a customer experience point of view. And so, there's no set way that we're looking at it, you know, the note formula kind of thing. But we're taking into account all of those things. And the kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software, and services to come together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it. And I think we have some really good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio of products, we're... you know, we still have relatively low share in a number of cases in very big markets. And so, we feel like we have really good upside there and we feel like we have a really good upside in the services area too that we've been working on for quite some time with, you know, four or five new services just coming online in the last year plus. And so. Yep.",2054.541,2167.486,2,2021,1,0.543,0.984,0,-0.061,-0.1309999999999999,0,0.569,1.032,0,0.687,1.633,0,0.906,1.817,0,0.975,1.93,0
"Yes, thank you. Luca, the iPhone growth exceeded your expectations despite a late launch. Can you maybe share some color on what drove that? Was it more on the unit side or the ASB side you referred to, to very strong mix? a couple of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter? And if you could share any color, if you're still supply constrained, and I will follow up with him.","Yeah, yes, certainly iPhone was one of the major factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that, and it's been fantastic to see the customer response for the four new models, particularly the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. So we've done very, very well, both on units and on pricing because of the strong mix. And we've had some level of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle of the quarter, two models after four weeks, the other two models after seven weeks. And so obviously we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very, very well. The products are doing very well all around the world. I think you've seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we've seen phenomenal customer response. Probably there was also some level of pent-up demand for 5G iPhones, given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G. And so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic. We believe we're going to be able to be in supply-demand balance for all the models at some point during the quarter. And it's, you know, the product is doing very well all around the world.",2207.957,2310.832,3,2021,1,0.502,1.4859999999999998,0,-0.066,-0.1969999999999999,0,0.6829999999999999,1.715,0,0.903,2.536,0,0.869,2.686,0,0.926,2.856,0
"Great. And Tim, you mentioned about the strength of the install-based performance, which continues to grow very impressively at this scale. Can you maybe help us think through how the switcher versus upgrade activity has been tracking in recent quarters? Would love to get your thoughts on that.","Yeah, thanks for the question. If you look at this past quarter, which, you know, we started selling two of the iPhones four weeks into the quarter and the other two seven weeks into the quarter. So I would caution that this is an early going. But in looking at the iPhone 12 family, we saw both switchers and upgraders increase on a year-over-year basis. And in fact, we saw the largest number of upgraders that we've ever seen in a quarter. And so, we were, you know, very thrilled about that.",2332.54,2373.396,4,2021,1,0.414,1.9,0,-0.071,-0.2679999999999999,0,0.621,2.336,0,0.119,2.655,0,0.912,3.598,0,0.965,3.821,0
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? Clearly significant sequential growth, which I think has a lot to do with iPhone. But I'm curious, both from an iPhone as well as, you know, your other product categories, what you're seeing and, you know, how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is. And then I have a follow up.","Yeah, China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year over year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone Keep in mind that 5G in China is that the network is well established and the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so, I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so, iPhone did extremely well. However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the company average. Mac was above the company average. Wearables, home and accessories was above the company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there. In terms of COVID, I think they're, at least for last quarter, they were sort of beyond COVID and very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring, but we have not seen that in our businesses yet. Of course, those cases are much smaller than the ones in other countries.",2408.819,2533.273,5,2021,1,0.47,2.37,0,-0.0669999999999999,-0.3349999999999998,0,0.642,2.978,0,0.928,3.583,0,0.86,4.458,0,0.974,4.795,0
"I guess the other thing I was curious about, with regard to the services business, you know, if we could dig a little bit more, I think this is one of the first times When, Luca, you talked about Apple TV+, Arcade, Apple Pay, some of the smaller services actually kind of moving the needle. And then I was also curious, you had a number of stores closed at least later in the quarter, and that typically has impacted some of your AppleCare revenue, and yet you outperformed. So maybe if you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the services revenue.","Yeah, I mean, it really has been strong across the board. There are two businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively. And then we talked about it in the past. So one is AppleCare. Obviously, when the stores are closed, it's tougher, of course, for customers to have the interaction with us and advertising, which is, you know, it's in line with the the overall level of economic activity. What happened during the December quarter is that in-store traffic improved. And so AppleCare, we grew. We didn't grow as much as company average, but we grew in AppleCare. set an all time record there in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running particularly in December, we started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States, but also in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to serve to support more customers than in past quarters. And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising. And so that also helped the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. And it's something that we've seen happen during the COVID environment.",2573.413,2659.61,6,2021,1,0.513,2.883,0,-0.071,-0.4059999999999998,0,0.602,3.58,0,0.1119999999999999,3.695,0,0.898,5.356,0,0.955,5.75,0
"Yes, thank you. I also have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more into iPhone. Maybe you can just, you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting Q1. And should we be thinking about above seasonal iPhone growth, given that you're still not in supply-demand balance and you had fewer selling days in fiscal Q1? Should we be thinking about sort of above seasonal iPhone growth looking into Q2? Yeah.","So on the December performance, as you know, Tony, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so we had an initial part of the quarter where obviously we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched, uh the new phones we also did the channel field that typically happens to a certain extent in the in the september quarter at the end of the quarter and the demand has been very strong and so we've been constrained as i said on on especially in the pro models at the end of december we exited with a level of iphone channel inventory which was slightly below a year ago And we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter. In terms of the sequential change, we talked about, during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be Similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, you know, fiscal 17, 18, 19, you know, that's our typical seasonal progression. And we mentioned a couple of product categories, services, and wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around iPhone.",2717.398,2821.231,7,2021,1,0.44,3.323,0,-0.0619999999999999,-0.4679999999999997,0,0.133,3.713,0,0.875,4.57,0,0.882,6.238,0,0.967,6.717,0
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The company, you know, this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue. Historically, you've eschewed acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth. And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward? Thank you.","Yeah, Tony, as you know, we give some color on the current quarter, but not beyond that in terms of growth rates. So I'll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, We have the strongest hardware portfolio that we've ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the future, both in products and in services. We have an install base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time services record. And we have that install base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature will contribute even more to the services revenue stream. And on the wearable side, we've brought this thing from zero to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat. But I still think that we're in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the other products, whether you look at iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom for market share expansion. And this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets where we're proud of how we've done but there's a lot more headroom in those markets. Like if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year ago quarter, but our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well. And of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we've been on a multi-year effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You've heard some of the things in Lucas' comments today, and we comment some on it each quarter. you know, very optimistic about what we can do in that space. And then of course, we've got new things that we're not going to talk about that we think will contribute to the company as well, just like other new things have contributed nicely to the company in the past. So we see lots of opportunity. Thank you for the question.",2871.995,3054.791,8,2021,1,0.513,3.836,0,-0.062,-0.5299999999999997,0,0.6409999999999999,4.354,0,0.943,5.513,0,0.835,7.073,0,0.972,7.689,0
"Perfect. I have two questions as well. I guess starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion. We really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39, I think since 2016. Could you maybe step back and talk about what has enabled this shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwinds or insourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels and what are the big drivers that got us here?","Well, Hamid, Of course, when you grow the way we've grown this quarter, 21%, it's obviously we have a certain level of fixed cost in our product structures, right? And so a high level of sales helps margin expansion without a doubt. And so that has been probably the biggest factor, to be honest. And then As I was saying earlier, we've had across the board, in services, in every product category, we've had a very strong mix of products. We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that's been pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very good. The commodity environment is fairly benign. And the one thing that has not affected us this time around is the effects that it's true. It has not been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katie, but at the same time, it has not been a negative. And the reality is that FX for us has been a negative over the last five or six years, almost, almost every quarter. And so that has, that has changed. And that obviously makes a difference.",3096.175,3173.749,9,2021,1,0.499,4.335,0,-0.0699999999999999,-0.5999999999999996,0,0.512,4.866,0,0.933,6.446,0,0.879,7.952,0,0.955,8.644,0
"Got it. Um, And then, Tim, when I look at the growth rates on Mac and iPads, they've been in the 20% to 40% range for the last three quarters, and I suspect some of this is just folks contending with the pandemic. But I'd love to understand, when you look at these growth rates, how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading what they have at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the Apple ecosystem? And do you see, I guess, what sort of growth rates do you think is more durable or predictable as we go forward over here?","If you look at the switcher or the switcher, if you look at the new to Mac and new to iPad, these numbers are still about at a worldwide level, about half of the purchases are coming from people that are new. And so the install base is still expanding with new customers in it. And so that's true on both iPad and Mac. If you look at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us a new growth trajectory that we haven't had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there's lots of excitement about M1-based Macs. As you know, we're partly through the transition. We've got a lot more to do there. We're early days of a two-year transition, but we're excited about what we see so far. The iPad, as we went out with the iPad Air, And we now have the best iPad lineup we've ever had. And it's clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements. Others are using them as complimentary to their desktop. But the level of growth there has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41%. And yes, part of it is work from home and part of it is distance learning. But I think I wouldn't underestimate how much of it is the product itself in both the case of iPad and Mac. And, of course, our share in the Mac is quite low for the total personal computer market, and so there's lots of headroom there.",3207.886,3314.994,10,2021,1,0.5680000000000001,4.903,0,-0.061,-0.6609999999999996,0,0.6779999999999999,5.544,0,0.952,7.398,0,0.915,8.867,0,0.971,9.615,0
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the record, Kato, from my side as well. I guess I wanted to start off with iPhone sales. I think a general impression we have is China and North America have more robust 5G infrastructure. I just wanted to see kind of what you're seeing in terms of customer engagement or velocity of sales for iPhone in Europe, where I think the general impression is that service providers haven't rolled out robust 5G services. Is that something that's impacting customer interest in the latest lineup in the region? And I have a follow-up.","If you look at the 5G rollout in Europe, it's true that Europe is not in the place of certainly nowhere close to where China is. and nowhere close to the US either. But there are other regions that 5G is, that has very good coverage like Korea as an example. And so the world I would describe it right now is more of a patchwork quilt. There are places that there's really excellent coverage. There are places where within a country that is very good, but not from a nationwide point of view. And then there are places that really hasn't gotten started yet. Latin America is more closer to the last one. There's lots of opportunity ahead of us there. And I think Europe is where there are 5G implementations there. I think most of that growth is probably in front of us there as well.",3369.365,3439.106,11,2021,1,0.448,5.351,0,-0.0529999999999999,-0.7139999999999995,0,0.454,5.998,0,0.7150000000000001,8.113,1,0.837,9.704,1,0.937,10.552,1
"Got it. As a follow-up, if I can just ask you, I think you mentioned the momentum you're seeing for the Apple I bundle. which I think has been a couple of months now since you launched it. Any metrics to share in terms of what you're seeing for conversion rate of customers or even insights into which services in that bundle are turning out to be the anchor services that's driving adoption of that bundle?","It's really too early to answer some of those questions. As you know, we just got started into the quarter in Q1, so we have less than a quarter on this right now. What we wanted to accomplish with it, we're clearly accomplishing, which is making our services very easy to subscribe to. Our customers clearly told us that they wanted to subscribe to several services, or in some cases, all of our services.

"Got it. Got it. Thanks, Tim. And then a follow-up for Luca. When you look at your services segment in the March quarter in China, you typically see a bump due to gaming downloads during Chinese New Year. So should we see a similar trend this time around? Or do you think with the pandemic and people staying permanently at home, that kind of seasonal bump might not happen in China for gaming downloads?","Yeah, I mean, and I think I was mentioning during the prepared remarks, we clearly in China, the March quarter is typically the strongest quarter for our services business and for the App Store because of Chinese New Year, as you mentioned. And last year, what what we saw was an increased level of activity because after Chinese New Year, the whole country went into lockdown for several weeks. And so that propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle.

"Yes, thank you. First question is on iPhone ASPs, and I know you don't disclose the numbers there, but I wonder if you could speak about it qualitatively. You spoke about the richer mix, but there were also some price differences as compared to a year ago. iPhone 12 came in at a higher price point. The Pro established a new price point. Can you speak to how that, you know, the level of benefit that you saw there? And going forward, are you confident that you can continue to improve the mix in iPhone going forward?","So as I said earlier, we grew iPhone revenue 17% and that growth came from both unit sales and ASPs because of the strong mix that I mentioned before. So I think that answers your question for the December quarter. What we've seen so far, it's very early because we launched the new products only a few weeks ago. What we've seen so far is a very high level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. We worked very hard to ramp up our supply. We've had some supply constraints during the December quarter. We think we're going to be able to solve them during the March quarter.

"As a follow-up question, if you could talk a bit to the benefit that you may have seen from some of the carrier actions, some very aggressive trade-ins during the quarter. Did that provide a benefit in your view on units or mix or perhaps both? And what would be the level of permanence that you would see in some of those actions such that, you know, if those subsidies were removed, could that potentially be a headwind going forward?","I think, Chris, it's Tim. I think subsidies always help. Anything that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously good for the carrier that's doing it and good for us as well. And so it's a win across the board. I believe that, at least based on what I see right now, is that there would be probably continuing to have quite a bit of competition in the market, if you're talking about the U.S. market, for customers as the carriers work to get more customers to move to 5G.

"Thank you very much. It's amazing how your company has pivoted and progressed through this uncertain time in society. A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know in developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product, and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically you are materially below that in market share. So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there's been some news reports of moving supply chain there or you recently opened up an Apple store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.","Yeah, there are several markets, as I alluded to before. India is one of those where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so, we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter. We're also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so, we look for that to be another great initiative, and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so, there's lots of things, not only in India, but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like. And I, again, I would also say even in the developed markets, when you look at our share, definitely everybody doesn't have an iPhone, not even close. And so, you know, we really don't have a significant share in any market. So there's a headroom left even in those developed markets where you might hear that.",3952.661,4054.73,17,2021,1,0.545,8.15,0,-0.072,-1.122999999999999,0,0.5589999999999999,8.94,0,0.634,10.038,0,0.883,14.787,0,0.97,15.766,0
"Thank you very much. Kim, I had sort of a big picture question on iPhone. I'm just curious, there are so many different things happening this cycle, you know, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for, you know, refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers? And, you know, are you seeing lives shortened given some of the, you know, the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of, you know, iPhone out there in the market.","Sure, Shannon. We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new to iPhone and upgraders. So, in fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. And so we like what we see. It's obviously the early days of 5G. Different countries are in different points. The penetration is still on a global level, is still low at this point. And so a lot of the 5G upgrades will be in front of us, not behind us. You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States, but a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.",1496.448,1559.161,1,2021,2,0.494,0.494,0,-0.0629999999999999,-0.0629999999999999,0,0.6629999999999999,0.6629999999999999,0,0.937,0.937,0,0.924,0.924,0,0.966,0.966,0
"Okay. And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean, 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember, actually, at this point. So, maybe if you talk about the drivers of gross margin, you know, and maybe – if there were any offsets from higher component costs or the logistics costs that obviously were overshadowed by currency and other things.","Yes, Shana. Yes, we did 42.5% during March, and we got it to similar slightly lower levels for June. So for March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by three major factors. Cost savings, which have been good for us during this cycle. A really strong mix, a strong mix on iPhone, but in general across all product categories, and that obviously was helpful. And foreign exchange, sequentially, again, from December to March, was favorable 90 basis points, so that helped as well. So those are the three major factors there. As we transition into June, as you know, we will expect some level of deleverage, but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange doesn't have much of an impact as we go from March to June.",1586.582,1650.214,2,2021,2,0.427,0.921,0,-0.062,-0.1249999999999999,0,0.5860000000000001,1.249,0,0.892,1.829,0,0.914,1.838,0,0.963,1.929,0
"Thank you for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, first one just on services, you know, I think 90 days ago the expectation was that line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter. It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd love to just understand, you know, what do you think drove that acceleration specifically and, you know, is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for services?","So, I mean, our services business did better than what we were expecting when we had the last call in January. It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that, you know, throughout COVID was that obviously digital services have done very well. And then we've had a couple of categories like AppleCare because many of the points of sale and stores were closed. and advertising because of the reduced economic activity that were negatively affected during COVID. During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on AppleCare, and obviously we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. And advertising, obviously consumer sentiment has improved, and advertising is coming back. And so the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter. You know, as we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories, but in general, I talked during our preparing March, I mean, there are a number of things that we always look at around the services business, you know, how many new paid accounts do we have, What number of new subscriptions do we get? Above all, is our install base continuing to grow? Are we adding new services? Are we improving the quality of the existing services? And so when we look at all these fundamental vectors of our services business, obviously we feel very good.

"Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, if I would follow up with you, you know, it seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months. And I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, has shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering, does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles having changed, end up in, you know, iPhones potentially growing on a multi-year basis because I would imagine if I'm using something more, I have to replace it more often. So I'd love your perspective on this.","Yeah, we're clearly seeing strong performance in both the new to iPhone or the switcher component and upgraders, as I've mentioned before. And, in fact, the upgrader was the best March quarter that we've ever had in the And so that speaks to what you're seeing, I think, a lot. It's difficult with just this far into the cycle to make a statement about the cycle in general, because keep in mind that we just launched midway through the Q1 period. And so we've only been operating for, you know, four and a half months or so. But clearly we like what we see right now a lot. If you look at how the iPhone did around the world, we had the top five models of smartphone in the U.S., the top selling, the top two in urban China, four out of the top five in Japan, the top four in the U.K., and the top six in Australia. And so it was a sort of across the board in some really key countries we did really, really well.

"This was a pretty unbelievable quarter, and investors are going to ask about the sustainability of current demand trends, especially as you lap some of the benefits from COVID in areas like services and MACs later this year. So I know you don't guide beyond or provide an outlook beyond the next quarter, but can you talk from a high-level perspective? Over the next year, which segments do you see the opportunity to maintain strong revenue growth versus where is it reasonable to assume there will be some digestion as consumers shift their spending priorities? Then I have a follow-up for Luca.","If you sort of look at the different products, iPhone, I've already mentioned some of the great momentum that we had there. Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year, the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first, and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in the middle part of March. And so part of the growth is compare, is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future affects primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so, we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges meeting the demand that we've got. The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home. and remote learning. And an iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. And the product that we just announced is really killer. The iPad Pro with the M1 in it. And so there's a lot of great things of the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode and so it would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical. If you look at wearables then, the watch had a fabulous quarter and I still think we're in the early innings on the watch. The number of new The people that are new to the watch is almost three out of four. And so this is, you know, a long way from being a mature market. And then the services by itself has really accelerated.

"And then, Luca, if I look at inventory plus vendor non-trade receivables, That grew only about 8% this quarter, which is a big deceleration from last quarter. Should we read into that as a leading indicator for the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June?","Now, as you think about the June quarter situation, Katie, I would point you to what we said in our prepared remarks around the two factors that will influence our normal seasonality, right? One is the fact that iPhone, we launched iPhone later than usual during this cycle, and so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes, obviously, the sequential change. decline steeper than usual, and then these $3 or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just said, primarily on iPad and Mac. So as you look at your model, and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that. From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So we reduced inventory as it's typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range. So I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward. Obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPad and the Mac, we wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac. But this is all a function of high demand for all our products.",2153.044,2242.614,6,2021,2,0.437,2.902,0,-0.077,-0.4019999999999998,0,0.088,3.346,1,0.872,5.444,1,0.914,5.359,0,0.969,5.782,0

Tim, your content offerings are still at very compelling price points and You've seen other content providers, whether it be Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, all announced price increases recently. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about pricing as it pertains to your offering here. And if you could share any stats around the uptake of TV Plus paid subs, that would be great. And I will follow up for Luca.","Let me start with TV Plus. TV Plus is going very well. As you know, the objective and the philosophy that we've had on TV Plus is to create high-quality original content and to be one of the most desired platforms for storytellers. And I see that happening day by day as we sign more shows and more storytellers, including Malala, as I mentioned in my opening comments. To date, we've The Apple Originals have received 352 award nominations and had 98 wins. And, you know, this is from Oscar nominations to Emmy Awards to Critic Choice Awards and all the rest. And we've got some shows that have gotten significant buzz, like Ted Lasso and The Morning Show and Defending Jacob and many others. And so we feel really good about where we are. We're not releasing subscriber numbers, but we feel good about where we are. In terms of other services and pricing, I don't have anything to announce today.

"Okay, thanks, Tim. As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low teens percent that we've seen historically, are the supply constraints of the $3-4 billion impact included in that, or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to? And any color on what specifically is driving the supply constraints at the subcomponent level? Thank you.","So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you mentioned a percentage there that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that, you know, we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter and the three to four billion supply constraints that we mentioned. And yeah, and, you know, the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting, you know, many, many industries and, you know, And it's a combination of the shortages as well as the very, very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, just to put it into context, the last three quarters of Mac have been the best three quarters ever in the history of the product, right?

And so on legacy nodes, there are many different people, not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes.

And so the revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family.

"All right. That is very helpful, Tim. And then maybe as a follow-up, I kind of had like a big-picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this, you know, one of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risks. I understand it's very hard to handicap that, but I'm kind of curious, do you think giving more public disclosure on a services business like App Store or would help alleviate some of those concerns? Do you think that's revealing a lot of competitive details? But kind of curious to know what you think on, you know, services disclosure.","I think with the regulatory questions and scrutiny, we have to make sure that we're telling our story and why we do what we do, and we're very focused on doing that. If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete, and so we can move and are flexible with the times. For example, on the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the – commission rate for small developers to 15%. So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so, you know, we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do.

hi thanks a lot for the question uh one of the things we've been positive about is how growing iphone sales can pull long watch and airpods sales as well as customers shop the whole store but you mentioned through covid that accessories do much better in a physical store environment and that's been hard due to the shutdowns obviously so uh my question is have you seen any improvement any attach rate for watch and AirPods with iPhone? And can it get a lot better from here as the environment gets closer to normalization?,"I think we get a lot of benefit from our stores when they're open and are fully operational. And, you know, we were in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously. But you know, we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores, and there's still some stores today that are closed, like stores in Michigan and stores in France and so forth. And so I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales, although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment.

So it's putting the user in the control, not Apple, not another company, but the user of where it should be. And so that's really the focus of it, and the feedback that we've gotten from users both before it went live when it was in the planning stages and so forth and after has been tremendous.

"Hi, thanks for the question. I have a couple, and just want to get into the performance by geography here a bit, and Europe really exceptional results, particularly for this time of the year. I know you mentioned some of the 5G iPhone upgrades are in front of you, and I would assume Europe's kind of in that category, but curious to hear, or maybe if you can double-click on what's driving the exceptional growth here in Europe, and Are consumers moving to 5G phones even though some of the service provider plans are not rolled out, or are we still expecting that to be much more in front of us?","Yes, Amik, I'll take that one. You're right. I mean, we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter, and it was probably one of the GEOs where we actually saw you know, results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board, every product category, particularly, I would say, iPad and Mac. You know, they really were very, very strong. Again, obviously, Europe has been affected by lockdowns. More than most parts of the world, the lockdowns have lasted longer. Then here in the United States, for example, Tim was mentioning there are places in Europe still today where our stores are closed. Unfortunately, we have a very strong online business that has really helped us. But working from home, learning from home, you know, limited entertainment options, that has all played in our favor. Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes the Western Europe, which has done very, very well. And then Eastern Europe, and it goes into the Middle East, even India is part of Europe. And those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than company average. So very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, Russia, Middle East in general. So it's been very broad. both across the product categories and across countries in Europe.",3317.397,3427.29,19,2021,2,0.518,8.211,0,-0.068,-1.3039999999999994,0,0.691,8.229999999999999,0,0.907,9.836,0,0.911,15.639,0,0.972,17.131999999999998,0
"And just a quick follow-up for you, Luca. I think overall you just wanted to understand the implication of the investment plans that you announced recently for the U.S., the $430 billion over a multi-year period, getting some questions from investors of how to think about the implication on the run rate of operating expenses for the company.","If you remember, we announced back in 2018 that we were making a very sizable commitment to the United States. At the time, we announced $350 billion of investment over the following five years. And, you know, during these three years since then, we've overachieved on those commitments and we felt it was the right time to update these type of investments. And they span from, obviously, the investment that we make directly at Apple. For example, you know, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years in the United States. And, of course, our business has grown. And so our commitment, for example, to U.S. suppliers grows over time. And that, you know, shows in the higher numbers. In the meantime... We've got into new businesses, for example, Apple TV+. A lot of the content that we develop for our TV service is produced here in the United States, and so that's additional investment here in the United States. From an OPEX standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years, you know, we said many times, you know, sometimes our OPEX grows faster than revenue. and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our OPEX increase, but we want to continue to make all the necessary investments into the business. We will never underinvest in our business, and so you will continue to see the fact that we will continue to grow our operating expenses, particularly on the R&D side, which continues to be the core of the company.",3450.629,3558.431,20,2021,2,0.539,8.75,0,-0.076,-1.3799999999999994,0,0.601,8.831,0,0.947,10.783,0,0.925,16.564,0,0.969,18.101,0
"Yes, thank you. Good morning. Just to dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit, just starting with the fact that last year, obviously, there was a later launch of iPhone than we've typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?","Well, as I explained, first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits. That's, I think, Chris, the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year to continue into the September quarter. We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%, and I've listed three factors. The first factor is that The dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis, but that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter, 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely our advertising business and AppleCare, that were significantly impacted a year ago because of the COVID lockdowns. And therefore, they had a relatively easy compare in the June quarter. And so we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter. And so we expect significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June. And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 and $4 billion to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter, and so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low end of that range that we had quoted at the beginning of the quarter. But we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double-digit growth for September with this caveat that I just mentioned.",1497.581,1652.429,1,2021,3,0.4579999999999999,0.4579999999999999,0,-0.07,-0.07,0,0.42,0.42,0,0.968,0.968,0,0.921,0.921,0,0.966,0.966,0
"And thank you. If I could follow up with regard to the supply constraints. And do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well? What effect will that have on the holiday selling season? And then in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of these supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product cost in general as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?","Chris, it's Tim. In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay. But component costs continue in the aggregate to decline. In terms of supply constraints and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today. We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time. And as you would guess, we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt. And Chris, on the cost side, As I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter, 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter. And I think you've seen that, you know, we provide a guidance of 41.5 to 42.5 for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.",1686.501,1749.763,2,2021,3,0.4,0.8579999999999999,0,-0.071,-0.141,0,0.373,0.7929999999999999,0,0.906,1.874,0,0.7889999999999999,1.71,0,0.955,1.921,0
"Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time. Tim and Luca, I just have one question, and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it. But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented, whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China floods, supply chain components. Just wondering for your R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair, or is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?","Jim, the company has been incredibly resilient. The employees are... really doing double duty. And I could not be more pleased with the cadence that we're coming out with new things. As you can see from the software announcements that we made at WWDC and the corresponding launches of the software that we plan on in the fall, and then all of the products that we've been able to to bring out over the last 12 to 18 months, it's amazing.

And so we feel really, really great about both categories. And as Luca kind of said during the preamble, our opening comments, our results are really strong for iPhone around the world. And so it's been a very, very strong cycle. And yet the penetration on 5G is obviously still very, very low.

"Okay. And maybe if you could talk a bit about China, up 58%. Where are you seeing the growth? What are you hearing from customers there? Obviously 58% is not sustainable, but how sustainable is the strength? Thank you.","It was an incredibly strong quarter. It set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us, and so we're very proud of that and doing the best job we can to serve customers there. We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong, but if you look at the balance of our products, We also set June quarter records for wearables, home and accessories for Mac and for services. So it was sort of an across-the-board strength. And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market. For example, Mac and iPad, about two-thirds of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product. For the Apple Watch, that number was 85%.

"Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess first off, Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September. I think sequentially it implies it's down 100 basis points or so. So maybe just touching what are the puts and takes that will be helpful because I think historically September tends to be a flattish, maybe even up a little bit gross margin number people.","Yeah, I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results, right? It's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total, and particularly with advertising doing really, really well because of the rebound that we saw from the COVID lockdowns a year ago. And so as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix. And so that That drives, you know, the guidance that we provided, which again, as you know, is significantly higher than just a year ago. For example, a year ago, you know, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis, right? And so I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.",2081.419,2145.178,7,2021,3,0.417,2.886,0,-0.072,-0.4869999999999999,0,0.374,3.155,0,0.851,5.017,0,0.846,6.046,0,0.959,6.736,0
"Got it. No, absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40 this quickly for you folks, so that is impressive. If I could follow up on services, and I know you called out the 33% growth this quarter as a bit of an aberration that compares with easier, but if you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you are able to have a higher ARPU, more monetization of your install base, or is your install base green? I'm curious which one's bigger. And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?","It's a combination of multiple factors, right? Obviously, the fact that our install base continues to grow and it sets new all-time highs all the time obviously gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services. And that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned it grew double digits again this quarter. So that obviously helps on the revenue side. And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. You know, as you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV Plus to Fitness Plus, Apple Arcade, News Plus, and so, and of course the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now. And so all that additional revenue helps. And I think it flows through our growth rates. As you said, during the last four quarters, you know, we are well into the, you know, mid-20s, right? So, I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.",2183.382,2262.269,8,2021,3,0.562,3.448,0,-0.065,-0.5519999999999999,0,0.626,3.781,0,0.924,5.941,0,0.921,6.9670000000000005,0,0.971,7.707,0

"Okay, good. First question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic and store closures and less foot traffic. When you net out all the puts and takes, was your business helped or was it hindered by the pandemic?","Well, of course, Katie, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that, I would say, on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. Obviously, with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong. On the other side, we had certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, AppleCare because our stores were closed, they were affected negatively. And certain products like the iPhone or the watch that are maybe more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores, but also our partner stores. So we had that dynamic throughout COVID. And now some of these businesses are rebounding. I mentioned advertising and AppleCare. iPad and Mac, it's difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past. For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what what that is. Clearly, and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time. I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID-free world. I think that would be very good for us and for the entire, you know, and for our customers as well.",2309.428,2439.411,10,2021,3,0.542,4.083,0,-0.069,-0.6729999999999999,0,0.362,4.137,0,0.839,6.656,0,0.879,8.251,0,0.962,9.266,0
"And just to follow up on iPhones specifically, if you look historically after a really strong product cycle, what which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12. iPhone revenues come under pressure because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, what do you think is different this time?","Katie, it's Tim. You know, we're not predicting the next cycle, but I would point out a few things. One is we have a very large and growing install base. As you know, the iPhones passed a billion active devices earlier this year. Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers. The customer set that we're seeing on the new iPhones is just amazing. It's jaw-dropping. And the geographic response is is pervasive across the world. And in the US, we have the top three selling models. In the UK, we have four out of the top five. In Australia, we have the top two. In Japan, we have the top three. In urban China, we have the top two. And so the response from customers all around have been great. Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and had A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love. The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing, nine months or so into this. And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products. We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software, and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that that I would consider if I were coming up with a forecast.",2470.247,2597.803,11,2021,3,0.543,4.626,0,-0.069,-0.7419999999999999,0,0.6519999999999999,4.789,0,0.925,7.581,0,0.906,9.157,0,0.962,10.228,0
"Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations. Fantastic execution. It's resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your install base of a billion-odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how old that install base is. And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. And if that's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces are. for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious if we could shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also how old that base is.","Yeah, what I would tell you is it's, first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely. But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3. Both were up strong double digits. And the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps looks extremely well. And so we're really pleased with it. I would remind you that the billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices, just for clarification. And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for June, for the June quarter that we've seen. And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world. And, you know, they're very, very low. We're at the front end of this.",2651.381,2736.363,12,2021,3,0.485,5.111,0,-0.073,-0.815,0,0.6849999999999999,5.474,0,0.927,8.508000000000001,0,0.827,9.984,0,0.96,11.188,0
"Fair enough. For my follow-up, Apple's probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. How does Apple determine what's strategic and something that Apple wants to make itself versus non-strategic And also I was curious, you know, there's a lot of, well, it's public news now that ARM is getting acquired by NVIDIA, and I was curious how Apple views that. Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?","Well, I think that that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else. And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. we'll only enter where we believe we have an ability to do something better and therefore make a better product for the user. And so the M1 is a great example of that. We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver a product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so we've taken our great hardware and software expertise and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. You know, it's powering Mac sales that are constrained. It's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it.

What is the normalized growth rate for the services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world?

Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results, right? But certainly we haven't done 33% in years. And so... that was a bit of an anomaly.

Is it display drivers or what exactly is the choke point on the supply?","Yeah. The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the variety that I think others are seeing that I would classify as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that that are where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that We try to get those. And so it's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, and I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on silicon.",2964.844,3030.177,15,2021,3,0.37,6.484,0,-0.0689999999999999,-1.0229999999999997,0,0.055,6.41,0,0.628,10.609,0,0.7609999999999999,12.552,0,0.944,13.999,0

"Great. Thank you guys for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter, what does that specific set of data points strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, you know, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year you launched the FC2 to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets. So does that mean thinking about the portfolio going forward, there's less of a need for a lower-priced product going forward and that, you know, the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high-end in nature as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.","Yeah, David, we had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets. In Q3, we set June quarter records in Mexico and Brazil and Chile. in Turkey and UAE and Poland and Czech Republic, India, obviously in China, as I talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia. I could go on and name a few more. It's a very long list. And so those results are for the entire line of products that we have. And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the lines. We launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today, and it's sort of our entry price point. And so I'm pleased with how all of them are doing, and I think we need sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. And so we put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone, and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy. And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.",3085.847,3175.863,17,2021,3,0.544,7.147,0,-0.0649999999999999,-1.1219999999999997,0,0.598,7.023,0,0.87,11.427,0,0.866,13.9,0,0.971,15.895,0
"No, no, that's helpful. I appreciate that, Ken. So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone, you know, is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well? You know, obviously we're early innings in a lot of markets. Or how do we think about that, you know, over the intermediate to longer term in terms of consumer preference for 5G in those markets, if available from an infrastructure perspective?","In most of the markets I read, it is really, really, really early on 5G. really early. And so I, but I think the top-end buyer is buying for the future as well, because they may hold their phone for two years or longer in some cases. And so 5G becomes an important part of their buying decision.",3198.567,3225.194,18,2021,3,0.342,7.489,0,-0.072,-1.1939999999999995,0,0.095,7.117999999999999,0,0.615,12.042,0,0.8109999999999999,14.711,0,0.97,16.865,0
"Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start, Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple I bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics? And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within services.","In terms of Apple One, as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more. And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now and think it's a great ramp for the future services, and more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service. In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is about ATT. With ATT, we've been getting quite a bit of customer reaction, positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not. And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.",3270.992,3372.477,19,2021,3,0.553,8.042,0,-0.069,-1.2629999999999997,0,0.608,7.726,0,0.768,12.81,0,0.893,15.604,0,0.955,17.82,0
"Yes, thank you. I have two as well. To begin with, Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage, but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat. You noted cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature or more structural, like vertical integration that'll continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? And on services side, You noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously a very high margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And I will follow up for Tim.","Yeah. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm. at this point in the cycle. For everything else, for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis. And so far, it's been very good, as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins, because on the product side, we're up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. It feels something that we've been able to accomplish and we were able to maintain, at least in the near term, nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural. On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services. And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences. And this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned, for example, that AppleCare has rebounded. And so those, you know, the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some something like changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin. We're very, very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.",3425.592,3537.324,20,2021,3,0.507,8.549,0,-0.0679999999999999,-1.3309999999999995,0,0.6469999999999999,8.373,0,0.961,13.771,0,0.923,16.527,0,0.973,18.793,0
"Okay, thanks, Luca. And, Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China, in particular, on some of the Chinese companies. It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact, given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues? And also, are you seeing any impact at all from these? And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices or Or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing? Thank you.","Well, for the quarter, as you can see, we grew 58%. So it was a strong quarter. And embedded in that was a quarterly record for services, which includes the App Store. And so we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID. In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and services that we're showing. And we'll you know, we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that.

"Thank you very much. Tim, I'm wondering, can you talk a bit more about specific supply chain issues you saw and how you've seen improvements, I think, during the current quarter, and how we should think about what products you expect to see most impacted going forward? Just any more color you can give us on what's going on out there, because clearly this is hitting everyone.","If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints, and it affected the iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac. There were two causes of them for Q4. One was the chip shortages that you've heard a lot about from many different companies through the industry. And the second was COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. The second of those, the COVID disruptions have improved materially across October to where we currently are. And so for this quarter, we think that the primary cause of supply chain related shortages will be the chip shortage. It'll affect It is affecting, I should say, pretty much most of our products currently. But from a demand point of view, demand is very robust. And so, part of this is that demand also is very strong. But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the 6 billion that we experienced in Q4.",1531.898,1615.348,1,2021,4,0.4539999999999999,0.4539999999999999,0,-0.07,-0.07,0,0.365,0.365,0,0.778,0.778,0,0.856,0.856,0,0.956,0.956,0
"Okay, great. So you'll sort of push forward in the next quarter as well. Just a different question because I'm curious. You're starting to sell more and more things on a ratable basis. And how are you thinking about that? I mean, you have the new max and we keep seeing you can buy for a monthly charge and that. How do you think that's driving sales and how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio that's now available? And I don't know if you want to tell us how much revenue is now under under a recurring nature, but it definitely seems as you're shifting more and more to maybe sort of a bundled sale or, you know, offering from a consumer standpoint where you just pay one price every month and you get, you know, all of your Apple devices and Apple services.","Yeah, the first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the U.S. as an example. shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so I would say that predominantly the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright. But we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. And so we want to give the customer what they want. And so you will see us do more and more things like that that will meet the customer and provide the price that they want in a way that they want to pay for it. I don't know the percentage of products that are sold that way today, but it is increasing.",1666.741,1733.364,2,2021,4,0.532,0.986,0,-0.071,-0.141,0,0.249,0.614,0,0.7989999999999999,1.577,0,0.847,1.7029999999999998,0,0.971,1.927,0
"Perfect. Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. You know, I guess when I think about the supply chain headwinds, you talk about $6 billion in September getting bigger in December. Kim, I would love to understand, how do you get comfort that this is really demand that's getting distorted versus potentially getting distorted going somewhere else? And as you think about these supply chain bottlenecks, you know, you wear the CO, you manage a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable this sort of peaks in December and alleviates from there? Or what does that trajectory look like for improvement?","Yeah, what I feel comfortable on is I feel like we've made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions. And that happened across the month of October, and we're in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID, and so I'm not going to predict where it goes, but I can just tell you that as of today, we're in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October. In terms of the chip shortage, the chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes. Primarily, we buy leading-edge nodes, and we're not having issues on leading-edge nodes. But on legacy nodes, we compete with many different companies for supply, and it's difficult to forecast when those things will balance because you'd have to know how the economy is going to be in 22 and the accuracy of everyone else's demand projections. And so I don't feel comfortable in... in making a prediction. I think it would be, you know, it would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think we've got a world-class one, and I'm sure they're doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.",1781.355,1881.02,3,2021,4,0.4599999999999999,1.446,0,-0.066,-0.207,0,0.6160000000000001,1.23,0,0.839,2.416,0,0.82,2.523,0,0.966,2.893,0
"Got it. And then, Luca, if I may ask you a question on gross margins for December, you know, you're essentially guiding gross margins to be flat, maybe down a little bit versus what we saw in September. You know, maybe just touch about, I think historically I would have expected gross margins to be up in December given how much revenue leverage you end up with. So maybe what are the puts and takes on gross margins that are resulting in a more flattish guide versus historical seasonality?","Well, as you know, typically, you know, obviously with December being the holiday season, we do get leverage, as you say. But it's also the period of the year where we launch a lot of new products. And as you know, we launch essentially in every product category, we launch new products. Demand is very strong. But as you know, when we launch these new products, we tend to add higher cost structures at the beginning of the cycle. And so that's what balances this out. Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8%, this clearly indicates a significant expansion.",1908.288,1958.288,4,2021,4,0.413,1.859,0,-0.066,-0.273,0,0.182,1.412,0,0.876,3.292,0,0.881,3.404,0,0.964,3.857,0
"Given the supply chain is blurring the demand picture for iPhone 13, what data points can you share that help investors understand whether demand is tracking to a product cycle that is flat, growing, or down from the very strong iPhone 12? And maybe on that front, Luca, you can also comment on where you exited a quarter from a channel inventory standpoint for iPhone relative to a normal product cycle and then have a follow-up?","Yeah, maybe I can take both of those. The channel inventory, as you would expect in a constrained environment, the iPhone channel inventory ended below the targeted range and is currently below it. And so that's that. In terms of the blurring of demand, We look at, Katie, we look at a number of different data points. We look at demand across our online store, demand in retail. We look through to back orders on the carrier channels, the ones that do take back orders there. We look at channel orders as well. And so, we have a number of different data points that we use to conclude how strong demand is. And we feel very, very good about where demand is right now. And we're working feverishly on the supply side of that.",1999.109,2060.334,5,2021,4,0.447,2.306,0,-0.062,-0.335,0,0.6589999999999999,2.071,0,0.624,3.916,0,0.926,4.33,0,0.949,4.806,0
"And Tim, as a follow-up, we've recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the U.S. and China. And the feedback is most of them don't want to pay for apps or services direct with the developer. They value the security, privacy, ease of transactions with the app store. So, how do you think about balancing the regulator's push for more choice with a customer base that's happy with the existing experience? And just as a follow-on to that, how are you and Luca thinking about the potential impact of services revenue growth rate as some of the changes to the app store go into effect?","Hey, the main thing that we're focused on on the App Store is to keep our focus on privacy and security. And so these are the two major tenets that have produced over the years a very trusted environment where consumers and developers come together and consumers can trust the developers on the developers and the apps or what they say they are, and the developers get a huge benefit audience to sell their software to. And so that's sort of number one on our list. Everything else is a distant second. And so what we're doing is working to explain the decisions that we've made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also gets by the privacy restrictions that we put on the App Store. And so we're very, very focused in discussing the privacy and security elements of the App Store with the regulators and legislators.",2103.348,2187.059,6,2021,4,0.5630000000000001,2.869,0,-0.0769999999999999,-0.4119999999999999,0,0.28,2.351,0,0.899,4.815,1,0.897,5.227,0,0.959,5.765,0
"Great. Thank you, guys. And I just have two quick questions. One, big picture theoretical. So, you know, you covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call, but maybe just a bigger picture on how you're thinking about it philosophically, given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. And what I mean by that is there's sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy. either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective? And, you know, how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time? And then I have a follow-up.","Yeah, I don't see a fundamental error that we've made, if that's what you're picking at in terms of creating the environment that we're in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand. They pulled their orders down. Things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than a straight trend would predict. And so the industry is working through that now. I'm making it a little overly simplistic. There's some other things like yields and things like that that are happening as well. But those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so what we're doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are are accurate as we see them and so forth. And at the same time, we're reducing our lead times and cycle times so that when you get a chip off of FAB, that as quickly as possible, it's in a product and shipping. And also helping the FAB partners increase their yields. And so those things are things that we're doing. We also support the CHIPS Act. and the investment there to put more investment in the ground. And so we're spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.",2234.387,2351.29,7,2021,4,0.469,3.338,0,-0.069,-0.4809999999999999,0,0.195,2.546,0,0.878,5.693,0,0.88,6.107,0,0.886,6.651,0
"Great, and that's helpful. And I didn't mean to implicate that you guys had messed up, just maybe came off that way. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you know, when you think about, you know, purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier, But maybe can you just touch on, you know, the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years? You know, it's been a key component of your success, you know, the tight relationships that you have globally. You know, do you think sort of this business model as it's currently sort of, you know, put together globally is sort of a permanent structure, meaning, you know, carriers are going to be an integral part of driving demand for iPhones? Or, you know, is there a sense that maybe it's a little bit more transitory depending on the part of the cycle that we're in?","I think that 5G has provided a once-in-a-decade kind of upgrade potential, and it's a multi-year kind of thing. It's not a one year and done. And I think we're motivated there. The carrier is motivated there. We have mutual interest. And the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it too. And so I think everybody's aligned on purpose. The model that you paint is, I wouldn't call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country. But in general, I think that the marriage, if you will, or partnership between Apple and the carrier channel has never been stronger and that it's on very solid footing.",2394.823,2465.901,8,2021,4,0.499,3.837,0,-0.062,-0.5429999999999999,0,0.599,3.145,0,0.861,6.554,0,0.854,6.961,0,0.974,7.625,0
"Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them too, and Tim, I will give you a reprieve from the supply chain questions. I had two on services. The first one is on your new ATT, the app tracking transparency feature, and all the headlines that have garnered recently, I'm kind of curious, the feedback you've seen or received from your advertisers and users and how it has also impacted search ads, your own ad business. I'm curious to know the feedback and then add a follow-up.","The feedback from customers is overwhelmingly positive. Customers appreciate having the option of whether they want to be tracked or not. And so there's an outpouring of customer satisfaction there on the customer side. And the reason that we did this is that, as you know, if you've followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right. And we've believed that for decades, not just in the last year or so. And we've historically rolled out more and more features over time to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user where we believe that it belongs. We don't think that's Apple's role to decide, and we don't think that's another company's role to decide, but rather than the individual who owns the data itself. And so that's our motivation there.

And then as a quick follow-up, I'm just kind of curious, you know, on the mobile gaming in your app store, you know, there have been some recent action by certain governments to limit game time. I'm kind of curious how that affects your app store business and those geographies. And is there a way you can quantify that, or is that too immaterial at this point? Thank you.","You mean limiting the time on games? Is that what you're getting at? Yeah, exactly. Like in China, they've decided to limit game time and things like that. It's very difficult to measure. Yeah, the policy that you're talking about for those people that don't know is there's a policy to restrict kids below a certain age to, I think it's one hour on Friday, Saturday, Sunday each.

What I can tell you is going into the cycle, if you look at our results from last quarter, we grew on upgraders and switchers in the double digits. And so, both were very meaningful for the iPhone results last quarter. And so, there's significant momentum in iPhone.

Thank you.","We've put our current thoughts in the gross margin guidance that we gave you, the 41.5 to 42.5. I would tell you that we are seeing a significant increase in freight costs. And I would assume that that is pretty consistent across different companies. And so we're clearly seeing some inflation there. Yep.",2765.255,2794.421,12,2021,4,0.241,5.271,0,-0.06,-0.8009999999999998,0,0.0,4.218,0,0.24,7.524,0,0.824,9.859,0,0.959,11.349,0
"And I'll ask both my questions at the same time. Probably the first one's for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected. You know, can you give us some details about what drove that? Was it Apple stores more open, so more Apple Care, or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or fitness? And then probably for Luke on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwinds going to get worse, and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there's two ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified three months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore the delta of $4 billion gets worse? Or are you just saying, and therefore it's above $10 billion for December quarter? Or are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier? earlier in the call. Thank you so much to you and your team.","Jim, I'm going to take the second question that you asked, and Luke, we could take the first one on services. It's just in the reverse of the way you coined it. On the supply constraints, what we're saying is that the amount of, the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so, it's important to know that we're getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant. And we have very solid growth year over year. And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It's just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter. Thank you, Tina. And Jim, on services, the 26% growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really, across the board, it's difficult to single out a specific area because we set all-time records on cloud. We set all-time records across the board, Apple Care, music, video, advertising, payment services. The App Store was a September quarter regular, so it was strong across the board. When we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business. The fact that the install base continues to grow, that's obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits. And so that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call, 745 million paid subs right now. It's an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right? And obviously the fact that we continue to launch new services, new offerings within the services that we already have, new features. That obviously gives us a lot of momentum going forward. We're very fortunate. Now it's a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months, and very diversified. We sell a lot of different services, and our customers... seem to really enjoy the experience that they have on the platform.",2854.378,3028.814,13,2021,4,0.4570000000000001,5.728,0,-0.065,-0.8659999999999998,0,0.5219999999999999,4.74,0,0.967,8.491,0,0.926,10.785,0,0.967,12.316,0
"Yes, thank you. For my first question, it's a question about your ability to recapture sales that you weren't able to fill in Q4, Q1, in Q2. And you have some experience in that from last year when the iPhone, not all the models launched at the same time and some were late. And you did recapture some of that as you went past the holidays. Do you think that we should expect similar behavior this year? And then with that also, will all product categories behave similarly, meaning that are there some product categories where if you miss the holidays, you just miss the sale?","I think there are some products that people buy as gifts, that if it's not there, that it's perishable. But I think that we have a lot of products as well that people will wait for and would expect those to be captured in a different time period. So it's a combination for this certain quarter, the holiday quarter, I believe.",3083.366,3116.242,14,2021,4,0.388,6.116,0,-0.0659999999999999,-0.9319999999999996,0,0.0349999999999999,4.775,0,-0.361,8.129999999999999,0,0.823,11.608,0,0.956,13.272,0
"Okay. As a follow-up, could you speak to iPhone Mix? And one of the things we noted is that the delivery time for all iPhones are a bit long because of the constraints. They're a bit longer on the Pro and the Max. Is that a function of supply or demand, or perhaps both? And again, I would imagine you have a little better handle on that this year, given that all the phones were launched at the same time.","Yeah, it's really too early to make comments on mix at this point, because it has been, we have been in a constrained environment, so the mix becomes more obvious once supply and demand are balanced.",3149.02,3163.03,15,2021,4,0.2269999999999999,6.343,0,-0.074,-1.0059999999999998,0,-0.0039999999999999,4.771,0,0.06,8.19,0,0.681,12.289,0,0.8009999999999999,14.073,0
"Yeah, hey, guys. First of all, great job managing through these supply constraints. It's obviously affecting everybody, so congratulations. And then, Tim, one for you, a strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that as a company they want to own, for example, software is high priority, but you're also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company was standalone. So curious about the kind of input and thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important. So why doesn't Apple, for example, what pauses Apple from looking at areas like that?","We look at ones where we believe we can make a substantial difference and have a level of differentiation. And so, you know, we've put a lot of energy in the silicon space because we have felt that we could design and develop products that we could not if we were in just buying what's available in the commercial market. And as you can see, more recently we made that call on the Mac as well and have shifted to our own chips there. And so it really depends on whether we see a way to do something that's differentiated or not. And I wouldn't want to rule anything out. It's more of whether or not we see our way clear to doing something that is materially better. We feel like we've done that in the CHIP area. Thank you for that, Tim.",3217.752,3287.342,16,2021,4,0.5760000000000001,6.919,0,-0.071,-1.0769999999999995,0,0.407,5.178,0,0.5680000000000001,8.758,0,0.7060000000000001,12.995,0,0.936,15.009,0
"And then I've got one for Luca. I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about the gross margins. So when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business. Margin was down, and same thing for December. But I think you're effectively saying that there's a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into OPEX, for example, marketing, et cetera, as opposed to COGS? Or is there something that maybe needs to be clarified here?","There is certainly, obviously, that we have launch expenses in marketing and advertising, of course, when we launch new products. But the reality, what happens, we always make our products better, which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product. The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season, and so the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the services margins are higher than the products margin, there's also a mix between the products and services business that plays into the gross margins for the company, right? And that's what you see as you move sequentially from September to December. Very well.

"Yes, thank you. I had a question broadly about pricing of new products. This year, Apple launched the iPhone 13 at a slightly lower price than where the 12 was launched last year in China. Can you maybe help us think through what are some of the things that you look at in deciding that, and is that an action that you could take more broadly in other regions? And I will follow up.","We look at a variety of things, including our costs, including competition, and including local conditions and exchange rates and, you know, a number of different things. And so there's not a, there's no formula for determining it. It's done by a level of judgment looking at a number of different points, data points.

"Okay. And as a follow-up, you've introduced a lot of new services over the past few years. And these have become a much more important part of the Apple story. Can you maybe share either some metrics on some of the new services like TV Plus in terms of paid subs? And how are you measuring the success of these investments?","Well, we look at a number of things internally that we don't share externally. And so you can bet that we're looking at subs and our foods and conversions and churn and all of the normal things you would look at with a subscription business but we're not going to get into sharing those on an individual service basis but what we're trying to do is give you visibility to the aggregate number of subscriptions that we've had which Luka covered earlier with the 745 across both Apple-branded and third-party.
