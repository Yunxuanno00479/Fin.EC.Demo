First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? Then I have a follow-up for Tim.,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Katie. So, yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously we had very strong leverage from higher sales, and the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services. And that was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we launched many new products during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. But so in total was very good. From the FX standpoint, really at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role, neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter. partially because of the hedges, as you talked about, but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar. They're still weaker than a year ago. Look specifically to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on. Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.",positive,0.563,neutral,0.774,positive,0.55,positive,0.956,positive,0.929,positive,0.964,1,0.563,0,0.55,0.956,0.929,0.964,0.563,0,0.55,0.956,0.929,0.964,0,0,0,0,0,0

And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just the limited visibility that investors have into the roadmap and any new categories that you might enter over time. without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity. Can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Katie, for the question. And thanks for not asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around We ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves. And that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in, unless it's an adjacency product of which we're looking at it very much from a customer experience point of view. And so, there's no set way that we're looking at it, you know, the note formula kind of thing. But we're taking into account all of those things. And the kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software, and services to come together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it. And I think we have some really good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio of products, we're... you know, we still have relatively low share in a number of cases in very big markets. And so, we feel like we have really good upside there and we feel like we have a really good upside in the services area too that we've been working on for quite some time with, you know, four or five new services just coming online in the last year plus.

Luca, the iPhone growth exceeded your expectations despite a late launch. Can you maybe share some color on what drove that? Was it more on the unit side or the ASB side you referred to, to very strong mix? a couple of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter? And if you could share any color, if you're still supply constrained, and I will follow up with him.",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, yes, certainly iPhone was one of the major factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that, and it's been fantastic to see the customer response for the four new models, particularly the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. So we've done very, very well, both on units and on pricing because of the strong mix. And we've had some level of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle of the quarter, two models after four weeks, the other two models after seven weeks. And so obviously we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very, very well. The products are doing very well all around the world. I think you've seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we've seen phenomenal customer response. Probably there was also some level of pent-up demand for 5G iPhones, given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G. And so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic.

Can you maybe help us think through how the switcher versus upgrade activity has been tracking in recent quarters? Would love to get your thoughts on that.",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, thanks for the question. If you look at this past quarter, which, you know, we started selling two of the iPhones four weeks into the quarter and the other two seven weeks into the quarter. So I would caution that this is an early going. But in looking at the iPhone 12 family, we saw both switchers and upgraders increase on a year-over-year basis.

Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? Clearly significant sequential growth, which I think has a lot to do with iPhone. But I'm curious, both from an iPhone as well as, you know, your other product categories, what you're seeing and, you know, how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is. And then I have a follow up.",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year over year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone Keep in mind that 5G in China is that the network is well established and the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so, I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so, iPhone did extremely well. However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the company average. Mac was above the company average. Wearables, home and accessories was above the company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there. In terms of COVID, I think they're, at least for last quarter, they were sort of beyond COVID and very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring, but we have not seen that in our businesses yet.

And then I was also curious, you had a number of stores closed at least later in the quarter, and that typically has impacted some of your AppleCare revenue, and yet you outperformed. So maybe if you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the services revenue.",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, I mean, it really has been strong across the board. There are two businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively. And then we talked about it in the past. So one is AppleCare. Obviously, when the stores are closed, it's tougher, of course, for customers to have the interaction with us and advertising, which is, you know, it's in line with the the overall level of economic activity. What happened during the December quarter is that in-store traffic improved. And so AppleCare, we grew. We didn't grow as much as company average, but we grew in AppleCare. set an all time record there in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running particularly in December, we started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States, but also in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to serve to support more customers than in past quarters. And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising. And so that also helped the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance.

I also have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more into iPhone. Maybe you can just, you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting Q1. And should we be thinking about above seasonal iPhone growth, given that you're still not in supply-demand balance and you had fewer selling days in fiscal Q1? Should we be thinking about sort of above seasonal iPhone growth looking into Q2? Yeah.",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"So on the December performance, as you know, Tony, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so we had an initial part of the quarter where obviously we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched, uh the new phones we also did the channel field that typically happens to a certain extent in the in the september quarter at the end of the quarter and the demand has been very strong and so we've been constrained as i said on on especially in the pro models at the end of december we exited with a level of iphone channel inventory which was slightly below a year ago And we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter. In terms of the sequential change, we talked about, during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be Similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, you know, fiscal 17, 18, 19, you know, that's our typical seasonal progression.

Thank you for that. And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The company, you know, this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue. Historically, you've eschewed acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth. And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward? Thank you.",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Tony, as you know, we give some color on the current quarter, but not beyond that in terms of growth rates. So I'll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, We have the strongest hardware portfolio that we've ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the future, both in products and in services. We have an install base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time services record. And we have that install base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature will contribute even more to the services revenue stream. And on the wearable side, we've brought this thing from zero to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat. But I still think that we're in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the other products, whether you look at iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom for market share expansion. And this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets where we're proud of how we've done but there's a lot more headroom in those markets. Like if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year ago quarter, but our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well. And of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we've been on a multi-year effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You've heard some of the things in Lucas' comments today, and we comment some on it each quarter. you know, very optimistic about what we can do in that space. And then of course, we've got new things that we're not going to talk about that we think will contribute to the company as well, just like other new things have contributed nicely to the company in the past.

I have two questions as well. I guess starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion. We really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39, I think since 2016. Could you maybe step back and talk about what has enabled this shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwinds or insourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels and what are the big drivers that got us here?",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Well, Hamid, Of course, when you grow the way we've grown this quarter, 21%, it's obviously we have a certain level of fixed cost in our product structures, right? And so a high level of sales helps margin expansion without a doubt. And so that has been probably the biggest factor, to be honest. And then As I was saying earlier, we've had across the board, in services, in every product category, we've had a very strong mix of products. We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that's been pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very good. The commodity environment is fairly benign. And the one thing that has not affected us this time around is the effects that it's true. It has not been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katie, but at the same time, it has not been a negative.

Um, And then, Tim, when I look at the growth rates on Mac and iPads, they've been in the 20% to 40% range for the last three quarters, and I suspect some of this is just folks contending with the pandemic. But I'd love to understand, when you look at these growth rates, how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading what they have at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the Apple ecosystem?

And so the install base is still expanding with new customers in it. And so that's true on both iPad and Mac. If you look at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us a new growth trajectory that we haven't had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there's lots of excitement about M1-based Macs. As you know, we're partly through the transition. We've got a lot more to do there. We're early days of a two-year transition, but we're excited about what we see so far. The iPad, as we went out with the iPad Air, And we now have the best iPad lineup we've ever had. And it's clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements. Others are using them as complimentary to their desktop. But the level of growth there has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41%. And yes, part of it is work from home and part of it is distance learning. But I think I wouldn't underestimate how much of it is the product itself in both the case of iPad and Mac.

There are places that there's really excellent coverage. There are places where within a country that is very good, but not from a nationwide point of view.

A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know in developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product, and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically you are materially below that in market share. So are you doing active efforts there?

Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, there are several markets, as I alluded to before. India is one of those where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so, we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter. We're also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so, we look for that to be another great initiative, and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so, there's lots of things, not only in India, but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like. And I, again, I would also say even in the developed markets, when you look at our share, definitely everybody doesn't have an iPhone, not even close.

It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that, you know, throughout COVID was that obviously digital services have done very well.

During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on AppleCare, and obviously we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter.

I'm wondering, does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles having changed, end up in, you know, iPhones potentially growing on a multi-year basis because I would imagine if I'm using something more, I have to replace it more often.

Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year, the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first, and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in the middle part of March. And so part of the growth is compare, is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future affects primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so, we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges meeting the demand that we've got. The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home. and remote learning. And an iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well.

One is the fact that iPhone, we launched iPhone later than usual during this cycle, and so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes, obviously, the sequential change. decline steeper than usual, and then these $3 or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just said, primarily on iPad and Mac.

As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low teens percent that we've seen historically, are the supply constraints of the $3-4 billion impact included in that, or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to? And any color on what specifically is driving the supply constraints at the subcomponent level? Thank you.",Luca Maestri,CFO,"So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you mentioned a percentage there that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that, you know, we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter and the three to four billion supply constraints that we mentioned. And yeah, and, you know, the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting, you know, many, many industries and, you know, And it's a combination of the shortages as well as the very, very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, just to put it into context, the last three quarters of Mac have been the best three quarters ever in the history of the product, right?

That is very helpful, Tim. And then maybe as a follow-up, I kind of had like a big-picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this, you know, one of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risks. I understand it's very hard to handicap that, but I'm kind of curious, do you think giving more public disclosure on a services business like App Store or would help alleviate some of those concerns?

If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete, and so we can move and are flexible with the times. For example, on the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the ??commission rate for small developers to 15%. So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so, you know, we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do.

Could you talk us through that and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?",Luca Maestri,CFO,"Well, as I explained, first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits. That's, I think, Chris, the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year to continue into the September quarter. We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%, and I've listed three factors. The first factor is that The dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis, but that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter, 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely our advertising business and AppleCare, that were significantly impacted a year ago because of the COVID lockdowns. And therefore, they had a relatively easy compare in the June quarter. And so we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter. And so we expect significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June. And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 and $4 billion to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter, and so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low end of that range that we had quoted at the beginning of the quarter. But we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double-digit growth for September with this caveat that I just mentioned.",positive,0.577,neutral,0.666,positive,0.519,positive,0.975,positive,0.937,positive,0.973,1,0.577,0,0.519,0.975,0.937,0.973,0.577,0,0.519,0.975,0.937,0.973,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40 this quickly for you folks, so that is impressive. If I could follow up on services, and I know you called out the 33% growth this quarter as a bit of an aberration that compares with easier, but if you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you are able to have a higher ARPU, more monetization of your install base, or is your install base green? I'm curious which one's bigger. And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?",Luca Maestri,CFO,"It's a combination of multiple factors, right? Obviously, the fact that our install base continues to grow and it sets new all-time highs all the time obviously gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services. And that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned it grew double digits again this quarter. So that obviously helps on the revenue side. And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. You know, as you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV Plus to Fitness Plus, Apple Arcade, News Plus, and so, and of course the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now. And so all that additional revenue helps. And I think it flows through our growth rates.

When you net out all the puts and takes, was your business helped or was it hindered by the pandemic?",Luca Maestri,CFO,"Well, of course, Katie, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that, I would say, on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. Obviously, with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong. On the other side, we had certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, AppleCare because our stores were closed, they were affected negatively. And certain products like the iPhone or the watch that are maybe more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores, but also our partner stores. So we had that dynamic throughout COVID. And now some of these businesses are rebounding. I mentioned advertising and AppleCare. iPad and Mac, it's difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past. For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what what that is. Clearly, and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time.

Thank you guys for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter, what does that specific set of data points strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, you know, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year you launched the FC2 to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets. So does that mean thinking about the portfolio going forward, there's less of a need for a lower-priced product going forward and that, you know, the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high-end in nature as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.",Tim Cook,CEO,"Yeah, David, we had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets. In Q3, we set June quarter records in Mexico and Brazil and Chile. in Turkey and UAE and Poland and Czech Republic, India, obviously in China, as I talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia. I could go on and name a few more. It's a very long list. And so those results are for the entire line of products that we have. And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the lines. We launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today, and it's sort of our entry price point. And so I'm pleased with how all of them are doing, and I think we need sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. And so we put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone, and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy.

And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now and think it's a great ramp for the future services, and more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service. In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is about ATT.

I have two as well. To begin with, Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage, but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat. You noted cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature or more structural, like vertical integration that'll continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? And on services side, You noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously a very high margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And I will follow up for Tim.",Luca Maestri,CFO,"Yeah. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm. at this point in the cycle. For everything else, for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis. And so far, it's been very good, as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins, because on the product side, we're up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. It feels something that we've been able to accomplish and we were able to maintain, at least in the near term, nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural. On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services. And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences. And this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned, for example, that AppleCare has rebounded. And so those, you know, the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some something like changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin.

And how are you thinking about that? I mean, you have the new max and we keep seeing you can buy for a monthly charge and that. How do you think that's driving sales and how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio that's now available?

And that began to happen in the U.S. as an example. shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so I would say that predominantly the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright. But we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. And so we want to give the customer what they want.

Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. You know, I guess when I think about the supply chain headwinds, you talk about $6 billion in September getting bigger in December. Kim, I would love to understand, how do you get comfort that this is really demand that's getting distorted versus potentially getting distorted going somewhere else?

It is difficult to predict COVID, and so I'm not going to predict where it goes, but I can just tell you that as of today, we're in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October. In terms of the chip shortage, the chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes. Primarily, we buy leading-edge nodes, and we're not having issues on leading-edge nodes. But on legacy nodes, we compete with many different companies for supply, and it's difficult to forecast when those things will balance because you'd have to know how the economy is going to be in 22 and the accuracy of everyone else's demand projections. And so I don't feel comfortable in... in making a prediction. I think it would be, you know, it would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But I do feel very comfortable with our operational team.

Thank you, guys. And I just have two quick questions. One, big picture theoretical. So, you know, you covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call, but maybe just a bigger picture on how you're thinking about it philosophically, given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. And what I mean by that is there's sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy. either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective? And, you know, how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time? And then I have a follow-up.",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer (CEO),"Yeah, I don't see a fundamental error that we've made, if that's what you're picking at in terms of creating the environment that we're in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand. They pulled their orders down. Things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than a straight trend would predict. And so the industry is working through that now. I'm making it a little overly simplistic. There's some other things like yields and things like that that are happening as well. But those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so what we're doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are are accurate as we see them and so forth. And at the same time, we're reducing our lead times and cycle times so that when you get a chip off of FAB, that as quickly as possible, it's in a product and shipping. And also helping the FAB partners increase their yields. And so those things are things that we're doing. We also support the CHIPS Act. and the investment there to put more investment in the ground.

You know, it's been a key component of your success, you know, the tight relationships that you have globally. You know, do you think sort of this business model as it's currently sort of, you know, put together globally is sort of a permanent structure, meaning, you know, carriers are going to be an integral part of driving demand for iPhones?

It's not a one year and done. And I think we're motivated there. The carrier is motivated there. We have mutual interest. And the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it too. And so I think everybody's aligned on purpose. The model that you paint is, I wouldn't call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country.

Customers appreciate having the option of whether they want to be tracked or not. And so there's an outpouring of customer satisfaction there on the customer side. And the reason that we did this is that, as you know, if you've followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right. And we've believed that for decades, not just in the last year or so. And we've historically rolled out more and more features over time to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user where we believe that it belongs. We don't think that's Apple's role to decide, and we don't think that's another company's role to decide, but rather than the individual who owns the data itself. And so that's our motivation there.

Probably the first one's for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected. You know, can you give us some details about what drove that? Was it Apple stores more open, so more Apple Care, or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or fitness? And then probably for Luke on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwinds going to get worse, and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there's two ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified three months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore the delta of $4 billion gets worse? Or are you just saying, and therefore it's above $10 billion for December quarter? Or are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier? earlier in the call. Thank you so much to you and your team.",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer (CFO),"Jim, I'm going to take the second question that you asked, and Luke, we could take the first one on services. It's just in the reverse of the way you coined it. On the supply constraints, what we're saying is that the amount of, the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so, it's important to know that we're getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant. And we have very solid growth year over year. And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It's just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter. Thank you, Tina. And Jim, on services, the 26% growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really, across the board, it's difficult to single out a specific area because we set all-time records on cloud. We set all-time records across the board, Apple Care, music, video, advertising, payment services. The App Store was a September quarter regular, so it was strong across the board. When we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business. The fact that the install base continues to grow, that's obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits. And so that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call, 745 million paid subs right now. It's an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right? And obviously the fact that we continue to launch new services, new offerings within the services that we already have, new features. That obviously gives us a lot of momentum going forward. We're very fortunate. Now it's a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months, and very diversified.

First of all, great job managing through these supply constraints. It's obviously affecting everybody, so congratulations. And then, Tim, one for you, a strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that as a company they want to own, for example, software is high priority, but you're also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company was standalone. So curious about the kind of input and thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important. So why doesn't Apple, for example, what pauses Apple from looking at areas like that?",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer (CEO),"We look at ones where we believe we can make a substantial difference and have a level of differentiation. And so, you know, we've put a lot of energy in the silicon space because we have felt that we could design and develop products that we could not if we were in just buying what's available in the commercial market. And as you can see, more recently we made that call on the Mac as well and have shifted to our own chips there. And so it really depends on whether we see a way to do something that's differentiated or not. And I wouldn't want to rule anything out.

I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about the gross margins. So when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business. Margin was down, and same thing for December. But I think you're effectively saying that there's a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into OPEX, for example, marketing, et cetera, as opposed to COGS? Or is there something that maybe needs to be clarified here?",Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer (CFO),"There is certainly, obviously, that we have launch expenses in marketing and advertising, of course, when we launch new products. But the reality, what happens, we always make our products better, which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product. The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season, and so the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the services margins are higher than the products margin, there's also a mix between the products and services business that plays into the gross margins for the company, right?

And as a follow-up, you've introduced a lot of new services over the past few years. And these have become a much more important part of the Apple story. Can you maybe share either some metrics on some of the new services like TV Plus in terms of paid subs? And how are you measuring the success of these investments?",Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer (CEO),"Well, we look at a number of things internally that we don't share externally. And so you can bet that we're looking at subs and our foods and conversions and churn and all of the normal things you would look at with a subscription business but we're not going to get into sharing those on an individual service basis but what we're trying to do is give you visibility to the aggregate number of subscriptions that we've had which Luka covered earlier with the 745 across both Apple-branded and third-party. And so we're giving you an aggregated view of it instead of at the individual service level. But you can bet that we're managing it at the individual service level.
