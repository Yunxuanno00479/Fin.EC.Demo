Yeah, just a follow-up. You talked about some in the prepared comments with the new administration coming in, but could you provide any more color or detail on the impact of recent executive orders in the new administration and any new opportunities or even just expanded opportunities on what you currently do?",Rick Nadeau / Bruce Caswell,Chief Financial Officer / President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, Brendan. Let me give you a little more color. Interestingly, there was an executive order that obviously was created very early in the process here to reopen healthcare.gov for what's known as a special enrollment period, or SEP, and that will take place between February 14th and May 15th. As you likely know, individuals can already purchase policies at healthcare.gov outside of the open enrollment period when they have certain qualifying life events. But this special enrollment period is adjacent now to a just-ended open enrollment period, and it seeks to provide access to individuals who would otherwise not qualify with qualifying life events during this time. Because of its proximity to the recently ended open enrollment period, the pool of potential enrollees is likely smaller than if it were to have occurred later. However, that means it'll be really the uptake will be a function of outreach and advertising and awareness efforts. And we note that HHS is committing $50 million to such efforts. As I was reading a bit more about this, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that nearly 9 million of the remaining uninsured Americans could qualify for free or subsidized coverage under this special normal period. And there's an additional 6 million that could qualify for unsubsidized coverage. So, again, marketing and advertising is going to be critical. From a state perspective, state-based marketplaces, and I make this note because, as you're aware, we have the privilege of providing call center support for the federal marketplace and the states that remain on that, also for a number of state customers. States are encouraged but not required to offer similar special enrollment periods, and many are going ahead and doing that. So what does it mean for Maximus? We think that given all of these dynamics, the guidance range that we've established that Rick spoke to in his prepared remarks likely covers the potential tailwinds that could be created from the executive orders. And, obviously, the effects of efforts to increase marketing and advertising and so forth will go well beyond the May end date of this special enrollment period and likely would manifest themselves in higher volumes of enrollment in the next open enrollment period in the fall.

I just figured there were some other moving parts in there. Bruce, I wanted to talk a little bit about the redeterminations. Obviously, Secretary Azar extended the public emergency, I think, into April. I'm not sure the specific date. There, but then there was also speculation from the Biden administration. I think there was a letter sent to some individuals about maybe extending the public health emergency program. um through 2021 um so i i'm curious your thoughts on redeterminations whether um if the emergency does get extended um you know are there opportunities that the you know states they're getting the f map um but is there opportunities where redeterminations begin or would they be extended all the way into 2022?",Rick Nadeau / Bruce Caswell,Chief Financial Officer / President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, Richard, I'm going to pick that up in just a second, but first I wanted to return to Rick so he could clarify something from your prior question and then we'll look at that. Okay. Yeah, Richard, I think I read the percentage from the wrong column. I read the revenue correctly. But what it is is we went from $366,571 of revenue to $405,245 for 2020. CQA contract did go down $9.6 million, and the disposal went down 1.1. That gives you an organic growth of 49.4%. That's 13.5%, 49.4 million. So that gives you 13.5%. That's a clarification off that. I'm sorry. I was reading the gross profit. I read you the correct numbers on the dollars, and I read the percentages from the gross profit. My apologies. Maybe I'm getting a little... I don't know. Pull that forward. the wisdom's priceless so let me go to the public health emergency uh you're absolutely right um acting secretary of health and human services norris cochran uh sent a letter to governors on january 22nd and it's easy to find um and i'll quote from it saying to assure you of our commitment to the ongoing uh response we've determined that the public health emergency will likely remain in place through the entirety of 2021. When a decision is made to terminate the declaration or let it expire, HHS will provide states with 60 days notice prior to termination. So based on that, you know, it seems like the handwriting is on the wall. At the same time, as you know, we need to continue to work with our customers to get their guidance too. Because on the one hand, this would lead to likely further suspension of certain work, such as eligibility, redeterminations, and so forth. But on the other hand, the prolonged conditions that would unfortunately cause the sustainment of the public health emergency, thereby enabling states to qualify, as you've also noted, for the 6.2% enhanced FMAP, would suggest that at least certain COVID-related response work would continue well through the end of the current fiscal year. So given all of these considerations, when Rick and I looked at our guidance range, we felt that it's wide enough to accommodate multiple scenarios. And a public health emergency, to be clear, remaining in place for the entirety of fiscal year 2021 would likely result with us being a bit more in the middle of the fairway. So we always say it's kind of hard to predict COVID work. And interestingly, some of the temporary headwinds and program changes that we've seen relate to the public health emergency. For example, the pause in redeterminations is clearly linked to the maintenance of effort requirement for Medicaid to ensure individuals remain enrolled. And that's a qualification requirement for the enhanced funding. So unlikely, right, that states would, unless they're willing to give up that enhanced funding, you know, begin redeterminations or other, you know, kind of program administrative actions, you know, prematurely. However, there are other, you know, programs that we administer, for example, the Debt Management Program for Federal Student Aid or outside the U.S., the Haas Program, that aren't linked to this public health emergency so our guidance kind of accommodates all of those last thing i'd say is that the secretary retains a great deal of discretion not just in the declaration of the public health emergency and when it's over but also discretion to selectively modify the terms of it to reflect conditions and policy priorities as they evolve so All I can tell you right now is that we feel the guidance range we provided, you know, accommodates the variability, and we'll take guidance from our customers and respond to the conditions, you know, that they dictate for the administration and programs.",positive,0.438,neutral,0.607,neutral,0.786,positive,0.973,positive,0.835,positive,0.97,4,0.438,0.0,0.0,0.973,0.835,0.97,1.4529999999999998,0.0,0.0,3.394,3.53,3.557,0,0,0,0,0,0

On your slide seven, you guys commented and highlighted that you think you can get to kind of a 10% to 15% operating margin, which is obviously a ton of upside in that out-of-the-U.S. Can you time scope that a bit? Just remind us kind of when would that margin potentially be achieved?",Rick Nadeau / Bruce Caswell,Chief Financial Officer / President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Donald. It's Bruce. And I do want to note that the commentary on Stage 7, I'll begin and then I'll hand it off to Rick. The commentary about the 10% to 15% margin is over a program's life, and the illustrative program is employment services programs, right? So you have to consider the portfolio of contracts that we have outside the U.S. as you think about the long-term margin dynamics for that business. But I'll let Rick offer the commentary. Sure. Thanks. Yeah, exactly what Bruce said. And I think the simple chart on that page tells the story. When we go through and we are considering how to bid a program, you know, we have to respond to the request for proposal that's sitting in front of us. And what really winds up happening in most cases is that the costs that you incur are relatively flat over time, but you build volumes throughout the program's life. And so accordingly, what winds up happening is that your costs are steady, but your revenue grows over time. So in the early parts of the program, you have negative operating income, and you can see the area under the straight line shows you a negative OI for the first periods of the program, and then that builds. And so what we do is we try to make sure that when we price the work, that when we put all of the periods together, that we're having an operating income margin that's in the 10% to 15% range, which is the average that we seek for the work that we bid that is fixed price type of work.

And would that be like fiscal 22 or fiscal 23? I mean, what is the, I don't know if you can sort of time scope that. It would take a couple of years to get there.

We've had over 50 percent of the work that we do outside the U.S. is on employment services and closed economies in Australia and the United Kingdom have been very detrimental to us in that regard. So I think that when we look forward and come out of FY21 and look into FY22, it will obviously be somewhat dependent on the pandemic. You know, we have a big program in the United Kingdom where we were scheduled to do 780,000 face-to-face assessments in this last contract period, and we're doing none. You know, that Haas contract is profitable, but not at the level that we would have projected if we were doing those face-to-face assessments. So I think that the return to open economies in Australia and the United Kingdom, some of the new geographies that we're working on with employment services, a return to normality in the United Kingdom, allowing us to do those face-to-face assessments, and those new contracts that we talked about are all tailwinds that ought to be able to allow us to improve the operating margin outside the U.S. over time.

Good morning. It's Bruce. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to turn it over to Rick to address and I'll add a little commentary perhaps at the end. Thanks so much. Yes, thank you. You know, with respect to Australia first, you know, the first quarter we told you that they were coming out of a lockdown. And they had strong demand during that Christmas period due to the fact that there was a lot of pent-up demand from the employers who needed to quickly fill some of those retail and travel-related jobs. Those are industries that we typically place a lot of people in. In Q2, our fiscal year Q2, they also achieved good financial performance on their caseload metrics and sustainments, or what we also call retentions. This really means that more people will be replaced and more people will be able to sustain their jobs or retain them. And that shows that Australia has really come out of their pandemic better than other countries around the world. The macro trend should really be in our favor down there. There is difficulty, though, predicting what happens quarter to quarter due to the pandemic, but Australia looks very good and is doing really well. I think embedded in your question is really also about those OUS startups, the outside US startups. Those are in multiple geographies, some of which are countries we've operated in for several years and others which are new to us. Those are outcomes-based contracts which typically take time to build up the volumes. This gives you economies of scale over time. However, in the early phases of a contract, our costs ramp up at a quicker rate and that will create initial losses. So the revenues will come slower than the costs that ramp up. So we anticipate several quarters of losses on these contracts before they turn profitable. This will be a bit of a drag to the OUS segment results in FY21. And as I noted, I think the startup contracts will drive an operating loss in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2021. As Bruce mentioned, we do believe that these These contracts are a good investment for us. They make sense due to the overall favorable economics over the life of these contracts. We do expect these contracts to deliver 10% plus operating income margins over their life.

Yeah, that's great. But I also want to ask about the pipeline Bruce was talking about with the increase, obviously, from VES and Attain. and what's assumed in the pipeline from that, and then more than that, I guess, you know, what's the potential pipeline expansion from the acquisitions?",Bruce Caswell,"President and Chief Executive Officer, Maximus","Sure. Brendan, I'll take that to begin with and ask Rick to chime in as well. I importantly want to note that there's no VES in the pipeline because the transaction has not closed, right? And also, historically, I can just give you a little more color. Historically, VES really hasn't had kind of a business development function. They have been completely focused on serving their VA customers, well, you could imagine. And so if there's deals that will be additive to the pipeline, Once the transaction closes, it will likely be synergy opportunities that we've identified as part of the process of getting to know VES, understand their capabilities, and taking a longer-term view of where their capabilities could be applied to other kind of areas of white space in the federal government. I WANT TO ALSO, HOWEVER, SAY THAT LIKELY THOSE PIPELINE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE MORE LIKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OUT AND NOT IMMEDIATE BECAUSE WE'RE ABSOLUTELY 100% FOCUSED AS WE COME TOGETHER WITH BES IN WORKING WITH THE BBA ON THE INVENTORY, AS I MENTIONED IN MY PREPARED REMARKS, THAT'S BUILT UP DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC PERIOD AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT They are very well positioned to address the needs of veterans for whom it's a dynamic program, and periodically Congress will authorize new benefit categories, and that creates demand that needs to be addressed. So that is absolutely our focus, which is bringing capacity and scalability and further capabilities to serve the VA. And then we would hope that over time, in due course and at an appropriate time, there would be additional pipeline opportunities for us to pursue. So that's the ES piece. Rick mentioned that we did see a meaningful uptick, a small uptick in our pipeline as we came together with Attain. You can imagine the process. is that the companies went through and scrubbed the pipeline to make sure that if there are any deals that overlap that we were both pursuing and looking at, we eliminated the overlaps. And then we looked at the pipeline that Attain brought over. And then we also looked at, are there deals now that we will be able to, as I mentioned in my remarks, pursue because of the combined capabilities of Maximus and Attain? I would say that the pipeline reflects A minimal number of those presently because we're still only getting started with Attain and really understand kind of what the combined capabilities now mean in terms of larger deals that we can bid and editors that we can go against. So the additive component to the pipeline would be really just what came over as that was in Attain's pipeline at the time of the transaction. which was not insubstantial. I'm very pleased with and I think the team's done a great job of positioning for those deals. Just to give you a little more sense of behind the scenes, you know, we make sure that if teams have been both looking at opportunities, we're looking at which team is best positioned in terms of customer relationships and, you know, teaming agreements that may have been developed and so forth to capture the deal. And there's been just a great level of collaboration between the Legacy Attain and Maximus teams in that regard. Hope that answers your question, Brendan.

Good morning. A lot of moving parts here. I guess maybe I'll ask a question about the state Medicaid redetermination, sort of the pause there. Can you help us think through kind of, I'm sort of imagining that there will be a release of work for you, some sort of bolus release of work for you at some point, maybe in fiscal, maybe next year, I don't know. But can you help us think through kind of what that could look like? I mean, how do you see these Medicaid programs getting back to sort of normal operations with these redeterminations?",Rick Nadeau,"Chief Financial Officer, Maximus","Sure. Bruce, why don't I go ahead and begin and then ask Rick to add to this. I think it was, I want to say January 22nd, there was a letter that was sent by the then acting secretary of HHS to all the governors indicating the intent of the Biden administration to extend the public health emergency through the end of calendar year 2021. We're taking our guide off of that, if you will, and therefore everything that we've spoken to in terms of our view of when redeterminations would resume and the impact on the fiscal year is that this public health emergency will extend through the end of the calendar year at the very, I guess, earliest, given what's been said publicly. You can imagine that there will be then a period of a couple of months, probably, you know, after the end of the calendar year as things ramp up and get going again. Our view would be that certainly there's a backlog that has been building up because common practice is to redetermine, you know, eligibility for certain tranches of the existing population on a periodic basis. And with that not having been done, it needs to be caught up. And so we would expect there to be some backlog related to that that will need to be worked through as we turn the corner into the next calendar year. That work historically has benefited from the scale economies of our operations. In other words, once you've already stood up an operational center that has you know, a back office processing capability, a mail room, you know, a document sorting and inspecting function, eligibility staff that review applications but can also do redeterminations. You can imagine that incremental volume related to redeterminations is can be handled with a lot of existing infrastructure. So we expect that work to be more accretive in nature when it comes back on than the standard kind of base eligibility work that we do. But, Rick, would you add anything further? Yeah, just three quick little quick things. First off, you know, we are assuming, we are not assuming the pandemic-related headwinds abate during the remainder of this fiscal year. So we're assuming that It does not help this fiscal year. Logic does tell us that there should be backlog. When this becomes work for us is really tough to determine. But Bruce is right.

And then in terms of you guys mentioned some employment services work in the outside of the U.S. I think you mentioned some countries that I'm not familiar with Maximus being involved in. Catch me if I'm wrong. I think Sweden, South Korea, Italy, I think you have some work in Saudi Arabia. But are these new geographies for you? Does this open up potentially new doors for Maximus over the next few years in these countries?",Bruce Caswell,"President and Chief Executive Officer, Maximus","Yeah. Don, let me catch you up a little bit on that and then ask Rick again to comment. So to begin, the significant opportunity that we're seeing, obviously, we spoke to the UK restart opportunity. But we had completed previously, and it gets maybe lost in the, like you say, a lot of moving parts here, a small tuck-in acquisition. in South Korea, and that small acquisition was in response to a market trend that we identified where the government was going to be requiring companies of much larger sizes than had been required historically to use privately provided employment service providers to place displaced workers back into employment. So we always look at, kind of going back to conversations we had with Rich Montoni, not just the propensity to outsource, but a change in the propensity to outsource. policy signaled a shift. The reason we approached it with the token acquisition is that time was of the essence because that policy was being implemented quickly and we didn't have the opportunity to enter organically. By contrast, we did recently organically begin operations in Sweden. And that was in direct response to the major policy plank of the coalition, the primary or majority party of the coalition government that had really run on a premise or principle of reforming the public employment system, which they felt was not... successful for Sweden. So there's an existing program, but also a new program that is being administered where cases are being transferred to the new one, the program's being expanded. And we felt as we looked at that situation, we had the ability to create the business and build the business organically, and that's exactly what we've done. As it relates to Saudi Arabia, we have had a strong business in Saudi Arabia historically. that has primarily focused on employment services. We've seen an opportunity there recently to grow that business as the government is both focused on driving employment, re-employment of Saudis in a post-pandemic era, but also continuing to advance the Saudization policy and initiative, which is to provide primary employment opportunities to Saudi citizens in lieu of historical policy that also had a significant portion of foreign workers in the workforce. In response to those trends and also the government's desire to continue to think about training and upskilling their citizens to take on kind of jobs of the future, we've seen opportunities develop in Saudi Arabia as well. I think the last one that we haven't talked about is Italy. Italy, we similarly were following... really a shift in policy that signaled an opportunity to do some work there, and that related back to the historic use of European Social Fund money or ESF funds to fund employment services. Without dragging you through the weeds of the policy change, We saw an opportunity to enter the market. We began, again, organically with a small business in Emilia-Romagna, and we've been able to expand into Lombardi as well. Actually, I reversed the two. It began in Lombardi and then went to Emilia-Romagna. And we're pleased with the operation of that program presently. given the overlay of the pandemic. You know, certainly Italy was, as you all know, extremely hard hit by the pandemic and it's taken some time to recover. But that method of privately provided employment services still remains a great priority of the government. I lay all that out to say we are very, very deliberate, always extremely deliberate about decisions to begin businesses in new countries. And it is not our policy or our plan around here to plant flags, but rather to look at the market very carefully, evaluate it across a broad number of risk factors, and only move into a new market area when we believe it has the potential to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders and to support multiple business lines for Maximus. So not just in the employment services space, but also in the health-related areas over time.

Are there, obviously some, there's different, you know, there's different policies that different states are following and, you know, some states are doing, have more restrictions than other states.

Are some of your states going to come back sooner than others, or is there some kind of central authority that means that not much of it will come back until after the public health emergency is over?",Bruce Caswell,"President and Chief Executive Officer, Maximus","Yeah, it's the latter, Brendan. The way it works is that in order for states to continue to receive enhanced federal matching funds during the pandemic, they have to agree to what historically has been referred to as kind of MOE or maintenance of effort on the program. I think they can't erode any types of any types of services that they're providing or diminish any services they're providing. And that means they need to do everything they can to keep existing Medicaid beneficiaries on the roll. There are some mechanics that we can share with you. Maybe offline it would be best in terms of once the public health emergency has been declared to be over, there's a period than when they can resume these activities. As I mentioned previously, it's not absolutely immediate, and I think it's actually tied to when they last received funding related to the program. But we'll clarify that for you. The point being, though, that all states have to follow that same set of rules that have been laid out by CMS. And you're right, while there are differences in the way states administer their programs, in this specific instance, as it relates to this population, they can't, you know, I guess they theoretically could jump the gun and begin the process sooner, but they would lose out on the enhanced federal money, and nobody really wants to do that.",positive,0.5,neutral,0.64,neutral,0.872,positive,0.831,positive,0.797,positive,0.965,6,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.831,0.797,0.965,3.128,0.0,1.641,5.359,5.307,5.841,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah, one question I meant to ask. I appreciate your time here. In the federal services segment, you mentioned that the addition of VES would sort of create a close to 10% margin, I guess, for the full year, if you include that. That looks like it you're signaling a fairly large step up in operating margin, I guess, in the fiscal and the September quarter.

Yeah, I do think that if we look forward, that should be able to give us a 10% or better operating income margin. I would say that you have to always recall that we have a large cost reimbursement style contract in that 1-800 Medicare contract that carries a lower margin. But, yes, we should have higher margins from both ATTAIN and VES, and some of our legacy work has also been somewhat camped down by the pandemic, and that should come back. So, you know, we should have 10% plus operating income margins in U.S. federal in fiscal year 22.

So that would exclude the COVID response work census and the acquisition. If you add $750 million for the acquisition and $175 million for the midpoint of expected COVID work, that would total $3.744 billion. We took a look at the FY22 consensus, which is sitting at about $4.1 billion, which would imply that we need approximately $360 million to fill in, which would require about 12% growth over that adjusted organic base.

I wanted to talk a little bit more and hear your perspective around the outside of the U.S. segment, kind of sensitivities around case volumes. I know there's a lot of assumptions that one would need to make there in terms of kind of thinking about those contracts ramping and how much volume. Can you just maybe discuss that a little bit? Thanks.",Rick Nadeau,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, Don, it's Bruce Caswell. I'll be happy to start and then ask that Rick or David could add further color. Probably the one that I would focus on in terms of WS's UK restart contract because that's the largest of the new startups. And as we look at it, It's a little deceptive in the sense that the unemployment rate in the U.K. is around 5% presently. And you might say, well, you know, they're just getting the program going. Will there be, you know, adequate volumes in that program? So to give you a little more color, there's a furlough scheme that the U.K. government has implemented during the pandemic that basically keeps people employed. And the furlough payments enable employees. employers to pass those payments along to their employees, as you'd imagine. So they really don't count as looking for work. And that furlough scheme comes to an end on September 30th. And as all those folks start losing their furlough money, the unemployment rate will go up because they're no longer considered, obviously, as they have been. And there'll be an increase in job seekers into the market. Couple other points. It's a mandatory program so that anybody that's been claiming benefits or is claiming benefits from government has to go through this program in order to avoid putting their benefits at risk. And we receive referrals exclusively from the U.K. Job Center Plus offices. The analysis that we have seen that the government did that underpins the procurement itself suggests that the eligible individuals that will be coming through those offices actually exceed the planned entrance under the program and the contract as it's designed. they had an independent consultant do that work. We also, as you can imagine, did a lot of analysis before bidding the contract packages that we did and successfully won. Our analysis also suggested, and we looked at labor market conditions and job types by employer and so on and so forth and very highly localized economic analysis for our contract package areas. And that supports also the assertion that there are adequate volumes coming into the program to meet the financial objectives. The last point that I would make is that this is a different contract than earlier contracts in the U.K., and the DWP was very focused on value for money and ensuring that the participant vendors in the program, or companies like Maximus, could have returns that exceed their cost of operations. The structure is similar in the sense that there are fixed and variable costs in the cost recovery scheme, and it's a performance-based outcomes program. But there's definitely improved protection to margin erosion that we would have seen perhaps on earlier UK employment services contracts. So if we take that all together, we feel confident in the, if you will, the profile of how the OUS major startup programs, including Restart in particular, since it's the largest, will perform as we turn the corner into the next fiscal year. And with that, Rick is going to add a little bit more. Yeah, just to reinforce, you know, that you're correct. Those are outcomes-based. That is an outcomes-based contract, and the UK is the biggest piece of it. I also wanted to make sure that you remember that we did those contracts to provide more than a 10% operating income margin over the life of the contract. So they will be more backloaded on the contract life, but they will also create a backloading in FY22. The back half of the year will be definitely improved by the maturity of those programs outside the U.S. Thanks, Don.

One of the things I'm sort of trying to understand is that sort of the Biden administration has been pretty aggressively encouraging people to go on these exchanges. I would think that's positive for you, and I would think I would see that in your numbers, but maybe it's not. Can you kind of walk through how you guys work with these exchanges? Obviously, it's the federal and the state.",Bruce Caswell,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. I'm happy to do that. So we have two roles, as you well note. We support the federal marketplace through the CCO contract that you're familiar with. And that's the, I'm going to say it's roughly now 37 or 36 states that remain on the federal marketplace because there have been some states that have been moving to state-based exchanges. That's actually been positive for us as well, as we picked up work in New Jersey and most recently in Maine, working with those states to implement their exchanges. There are others in the pipeline. It's well known that Virginia is considering and will be moving to a state-based exchange as well. And we have our legacy state-based exchange contracts in large states, including New York and others that you're familiar with. So A couple things. First of all, I think that there was a reasonable uptick in exchange enrollments corresponding to the extended special enrollment period that was, I believe, kind of January 15th through May 15th of this year. Some numbers would suggest that there were about 2 million additional Americans that enrolled during that period. And those volumes that would be baked into our numbers, they're spread out significantly, but we were able to accommodate that within the staffing profile, particularly on our large federal contract. I think what starts to get more interesting are two things. The Biden administration has come out with a proposed rule that still has to go through the regulatory process that would further encourage and create an environment where more individuals can get into exchange benefit plans over time. And the reason they're focused on this is as redeterminations come back in for Medicaid, there's a concern that you could have as many as you know, 10 million Americans, because Medicaid enrollments themselves were up about close to 10 million during the pandemic period. So you could have a lot of people that, now that they're getting back into jobs, depending on their income levels, may no longer qualify for Medicaid, but need some type of health benefit coverage. And I think it was on July 22nd that CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure spoke at Georgetown University and talked about how CMS is extremely focused on ensuring that people don't have a benefit cliff. And when redeterminations begin again, they need to get into the exchanges. So there's a pending rulemaking that would create a special enrollment period each month, particularly for individuals with low income. And also the Biden administration is here probably where through executive orders and other proposed rulemaking is finding ways to, for example, decrease the amount of out-of-pocket costs for individuals buying coverage on the exchanges and so forth. So, you know, I think that we have yet to see, honestly, the effect on the exchanges of those dynamics. And that's something that we'd likely see, you know, more like in the first quarter and second quarter of next year as the redeterminations begin again and as we start to exit the public health emergency, and individuals need to replace their current coverage with new coverage, in many cases, advanced premium tax credit or subsidized exchange coverage.

Thanks for all the details in the presentation and the call, especially on organic growth. So really appreciate that. Bruce, I was wondering if we could just talk about the pipeline a little bit. Obviously, you've done these acquisitions here over the last several months. And how do those factor into the pipeline? How should we be thinking about that? whether that, you know, they've been included in the pipeline, whereas maybe the last time you reported they were not.",David Mutrin,Senior Vice President of Finance,"I'm happy to address that. Thanks, Richard. Good question. A couple points, and then I'll ask Rick or David if they have anything further to add. The pipeline does reflect, if you will, the bringing together of the attained federal pipeline and our existing Maximus pipeline and obviously any new opportunities that have been created as a consequence of that transaction. Maybe a small point, but in my prepared remarks, we talked about the new award at the IRS, and that was made under the Alliant II vehicle, and we talked for some time about how important that vehicle is to us and our future and how it's a vehicle that was very desirable for Attain. So the pipeline would reflect new opportunities, for example, that Attain Federal would now have access to through Alliant 2 or other vehicles that we had. So that is baked into the numbers that you're seeing. VES, on the other hand, it's important to note, never really did any business development outside of the Veterans Administration, and for good reason, because the work that they have during these medical disability examinations has been quite significant, and there is excess inventory that the existing vendors need to address. And that excess inventory has only really, quite frankly, been building as Congress has been looking at and authorizing additional benefit categories. And so there are things like the blue water benefits related to Agent Orange. There's the burn pit benefits. and other benefits that will continue to support the significant inventory of work to be done just for the VA over time. Now, that said, when we look hard at other players in that business, it's evident to us that there are There's significant other work in federal government agencies, in particular in places like the Defense Health Administration or the Armed Services, that aligns extremely well with the capabilities that we now have as part of the ATAN acquisition. So there are pipeline opportunities out there, but don't forget, our pipeline right now only captures opportunities that are two years out or closer. And so, you know, we're absolutely focused in the near term on supporting our VA customer. I think we've said before that if we anticipate pipeline yield from the VES acquisition, it's more probably of a 24, 25 event, because it will take some time to develop those opportunities, and they'd be further than two years out of this time and not yet reflected in the pipeline. But they're meaningful from my perspective, having looked at them and looked at those programs and assessed our competitiveness, they're certainly meaningful in nature david is going to add something yeah richard just to clarify one thing the attain pipeline was also included in our 331 pipeline number since we had acquired them on march 1st great okay",positive,0.567,neutral,0.627,neutral,0.562,positive,0.841,positive,0.928,positive,0.973,4,0.567,0.0,0.0,0.841,0.928,0.973,2.2119999999999997,0.0,1.059,3.7159999999999997,3.661,3.871,0,0,0,0,0,0

They're obviously doing the EHR modernization for the VA, and there's been a lot of questions and whatnot with respect to that. that process going forward and delays. I'm just curious, you know, with your VA business, is there any, like, you know, maybe collateral damage with that program in terms of just mindshare at VA where, you know, maybe They are so focused on that that other contracts and stuff like that maybe get pushed to the side. Any thoughts in and around that? I know it's an oddball question.",Bruce Caswell,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Oh, no, it's an interesting question, and I think I have two responses. The first is that we're talking about two different parts of the VA for the programs that we administer versus the Cerner one. If I'm not mistaken, the Cerner implementation is really focused on the Veterans Health Administration, or the VHA, and our customer for the medical disability examinations is the Veterans Benefit Administration, or the VA. And so, you know, kind of separate procurement organizations, certainly separate program offices, Where there might be, like, a long-term downstream impact, I guess, would be if veterans are authorized for certain benefits and those benefits also correspond with further health care in the VA system. You know, to the degree that Cerner implementation in some way slows down the delivery of health care, there could be an effect on all veterans, right? But there's really no ??but getting them in the front door and getting them determined eligible for benefits is a completely independent operation and independent function. from the function of the hospitals themselves and the implementation of the Cerner platform. The area where the second half of the question are really more maybe 25% would be we're excited about the new capabilities that Attain brings us, and historically, Attain has done a little bit of work in the VA, but not a lot. And, you know, we think there are opportunities related to technology over the longer term in the VA, where now being a more known entity and known quantity to the VA, we could be eligible to bid.

Sorry to keep bugging you, but one follow-up for me. I'm trying to sort of look at your sales pipeline and try to discern whether you're seeing growth there. I know you guys have put new sales leadership in federal and U.S. services, and I know there's a lot of, like, ups and downs in the broader macro backdrops. Can you kind of talk about how much maybe Attain added to the sales pipeline following up on a former, I think, Richard's question? Just trying to get a sense of what is that trending higher or, you know, can you elaborate on that, if that's possible?",Bruce Caswell,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Maybe what I should do is begin by giving a little bit of a backdrop on the comment we made about some delays in the pipeline still related to the pandemic. and let you kind of break that up by segment, and then we can get into the details. We've probably seen the most pronounced delay or pressure in the U.S. services segment as it relates to ??I can think, for example, there are several amendments related to our work for certain customers that we would have previously thought would fall into FY21, which are more on the bubble, could be Q4 events, could be FY22 events. and those do i think reflect the fact that state level customers have you know um less robust at times procurement shops and contracting kind of capacity and when they're focused on pandemic related responses things that may be more routine in nature or new programs that you know it's okay if they if they shift a little bit um can be delayed and so i'd say the us services pipeline if anything has been has been affected by that. Outside the U.S., I would say that employment services in that area in particular, we've seen very solid procurement cadences, I mean, as evidenced by the new wins we've had and so forth. So that then brings us to federal. Federal's probably been the strongest from a pipeline standpoint in terms of new opportunities. We are thrilled that, you know, a good example would be the IRS. The IRS has been in the engine room of responding to the pandemic with, you know, major call centers stood up to handle, you know, inquiries from taxpayers and so forth, but still at the same time moving ahead with procurements related to modernization and some wins that we spoke about in my prepared remarks. And so, I'd say that's fairly consistent with other agencies. There are, I can think of a couple of departments where they're still kind of sorting out what their strategy is going to be in the new administration compared to the prior. And so there have been some delays there. You might have had some modernization. programs that were kind of teed up in the prior administration that the current administration is rethinking, and that's caused a bit of a reshuffling or cancellation of prior procurements and consideration of new procurement approaches. So I won't say that everything in federal has kind of gotten back to what we'd consider a normal cadence of opportunities. But federal's been strong. The pipeline has been strong. As we've talked about, we've have new sales leadership in the federal team. I think it's worth noting that that new sales leader has a history actually as a chief information officer in the federal government, very connected to the customers, and was one of the very senior leaders that came over as part of the Attain federal acquisition. If anything, that should send a signal in terms of where we feel quite optimistic about the growth trajectory of the business going forward. And so as a result, you know, while we haven't broken out the attained federal contribution to the pipeline specifically, I think the point is we feel that we're at a period of pivot, and we have some momentum moving into this new area of IT, digital IT services, consulting, and application development, and really the beginning of systems integration competencies. And we're trying to energize that with the sales leadership and the sales team in the organization. So I think the contributions from Attain to the pipeline over time will only be growing. And if you were to look at that, I might just conclude by saying, again, it's publicly available data from Bloomberg and other sources. We've said many times that we want to be in the fast-moving current of an otherwise, you know, gradually moving river. And that area of IT services consulting, you know, and application modernization is the fastest-growing segment of the federal marketplace.

Good morning, and Rick, best of luck with your future endeavors.

Correct me if I'm wrong with that. That sort of seems to be the message here. And then one of the big variables is sort of the restarting of these redeterminations. And I just wanted to get a sense of your confidence around the timing of that or what visibility you have on that or any quantification of that.",James Francis,Vice President of Investor Relations,"Thank you for the comments. I'll let David Mutren answer that question, but I do appreciate it. Sure. Thanks, Don. Yeah, you heard in my prepared remarks that we did say that 60 to 65 percent of the earnings are expected to be in the back half of the year, so I follow your math there. With respect to the redeterminations, what I would say, our guidance is built on the assumption that April 1st would be the resumption of those in our program. While I pointed out that that risk, along with the risk of other new business potentially not starting on time, could put some pressure on our guidance, I would say that the bottom end of our range could accommodate some flip in that timing. And, Don, this is Bruce Caswell. I just wanted to give you a little kind of policy color on this as well. This topic of what's being referred to at CMS and more broadly as the PHE unwinding is getting a lot of attention these days. I mean, going back to the summer when CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure spoke about the importance of ensuring that the 10 to 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries that gained coverage during the pandemic period don't fall off the Medicaid cliff and lose coverage. What we're seeing is a continued dialogue with states. As recently as the National Association of Medicaid Directors or NAMD conference that's just concluded, this is a topic of great discussion. So my sense is there's a lot of planning going on right now. Because not only are we talking about those that gained coverage, because Medicaid enrollments went from 71 to 82 million during the pandemic, but effectively 80 million folks have to be redetermined for eligibility. And so the tight choreography that's needed between the existing Medicaid programs and the exchanges, because the likelihood is Not everybody's going to pick up employer-sponsored insurance, but rather qualify for subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act and so forth. That choreography needs to be very tight so that there's a seamless continuity of benefits for individuals. What we are sensing is there's a great deal of now kind of operational dialogue around that topic, which suggests that the assumption that we've based our numbers on is a solid assumption presently. I will caveat that by saying you never know what's going to happen with this pandemic, right? And any further strains or variants or anything that could cause that to shift. But this is a different environment than it was a quarter ago as it relates to the operational dialogue around this topic. Great. Thanks, Don.

For Advantage, if you look at the filings of the seller of that business, you can see that it was running at about $130 to $140 million of revenue per year.

Let me just quickly say, let me add something here. You know, we have an appointment later today with a shareholder who'd like to cover a topic with the management team. We thought this audience on the call today might like to hear the answer as well. topic is the Advantage business that you explained earlier. Could you speak to how Maximus is handling the transition and what steps are being taken to address the risks on this contract? That would be, I think, helpful for everyone. Absolutely. I'd be happy to. So, first of all, I'd like to begin by saying that the Navient team that's been running this program to date has been a top provider in the program for two important elements that are critical to borrowers. One is called risk outreach, and this is the process by which loan accounts are profiled in terms of risk, and obviously risk in terms of falling into delinquency, and there are proactive outreach steps that are taken, including the mailing of reminders and so forth to those accounts to try to help keep them current. The second component is called income-driven repayment, or IDR. On both of those KPIs, the Navient team has really provided excellent service historically. We're excited to welcome them to Maximus to continue to provide that service. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's very important to note that unlike Navient, we are not providing consolidated or originating loans. So we don't have the same risk profile nor potential prospective conflict of interest. We're servicing loans for which the federal government was the direct lender in a conflict-free and independent manner. All the providers you can anticipate will be facing a very dynamic loan pool when payment obligations resume in February of 2022, which could lead to a number of delinquencies that need to be addressed as the program is reinstated. It's super important that there be adequate customer service staffing during this period because This will all go into effect at the same time for all borrowers rather than in a phased approach. So we're preparing our staffing to ensure that we're answering the phones on time and continuing the same level of risk outreach that have been provided historically by the Navient team. We're very committed as a company to a borrower-centric model. That should come as no surprise. We pride ourselves on providing citizen-centric services in the programs that we administer. And we look forward to working in partnership with FSA as they envision a borrower experience that also improves transparency and accountability in the program. To that end, I might also add that the contract that was novated to us was extended, and all of the servicers now on that contract have strong terms and conditions. that underpin really that intent by FSA, but quite frankly, aligned to work that we do in normal course every day on contracts that we operate. So there's a minimum threshold established for customer satisfaction. There are metrics like abandonment rate, very common in the work that we do. There's a metric related to interaction quality monitoring and accuracy as well. We think those are good things. Contractors are required to respond in a full and timely manner to borrower complaints related to contract performance and so forth, which we also think is a good thing. So, look, over time we believe that achieving the SLAs and the KPIs that we will now have on this contract will lead to and we know will be a substantial driver in the assignment of new accounts in greater volumes. So we're very much supportive, it goes without saying, of a model like this where contractors are held accountable. Great. Thanks for those thoughts, Bruce.
