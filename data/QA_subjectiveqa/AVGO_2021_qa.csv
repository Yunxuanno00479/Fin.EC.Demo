Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hawk, some good color on the supply side of the equation and a little bit about your lead times extending. I wanted to dive a little bit into that. Last quarter you talked about a backlog. I think the number was $14 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of your backlog today, how it is on an absolute level, and the sustainability of it as investors are wondering if this demand is just too good to be sustainable, and what does it mean to excess bookings, double ordering, that sort of inventory digestion that will inevitably follow thereafter?",Hock Tan,President and CEO,"Well, that's a very interesting question, a very, very appropriate question at this time. And as I said, we have had, as I indicated, we started this process almost nine months ago of seeing demand that are quite strong, and we started a process of thinking how we best ensure very, very good use of our supply chain capacity. And basically, as I said, we went through this process rigorously scrubbing our backlog. And by the way, our entire backlog, virtually our entire backlog, follow a set of terms, a key set of terms we mentioned before, which is non-cancellable for any of the customers who booked us. And they still apply, more so than ever. So double bookings, from our point of view, it's never been an issue. And as we stretch out lead times, we are seeing customers, obviously, booked for delivery dates, for customer request dates that are further out. So that makes sense, too. And that's why it makes the process of being able to match customer consumption as close as we could do it against what we supply to be something that makes sense. And we've done that, and I think we are fairly, we could always do better, but we feel pretty good that we have a reasonable process in place that ensures that our customers get their products. And maybe just in time, but they do get their products when they need it. And we believe we have managed this process of supply, demand, and imbalance very, very well as I indicated. And in fact, as I meant to repeat the point I highlighted, our revenue year on year in Q1 was up 17%, but as I also indicated, our bookings was up 63%. That by itself proves there is a lot of demand, and people are booking out very far. We are virtually 90% booked for 2021. And if you laid out what they need, and we believe This is real, because they can't cancel it. And obviously in order to reach that point, to one of your points, has our backlog as we begin Q2 increased from when we began Q1? Yes, it has. It has, and quite significantly. As we start to see lead times even stretch out more. And the strength, we believe, of our products not only products that are incumbent and used today, but what is coming down the pipe as next generation products, which have already released, but await launching, is proven by the fact that we have customers, many of them, and reflecting our backlog, who are willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.",positive,0.652,neutral,0.609,positive,0.67,positive,0.929,positive,0.91,positive,0.977,1,0.652,0.0,0.67,0.929,0.91,0.977,0.652,0.0,0.67,0.929,0.91,0.977,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for taking my question. Hawk, you know, the biggest concern by investors right now is your ability to drive growth in the seasonally stronger second half of your fiscal year, your July and October quarters. when you start to ramp into your flagship smartphone customers. If I just apply normal seasonal trends in wireless combined with, let's say, sustained networking strength and, as you mentioned, recovery and storage, that would get me revenues in the second half in that sort of $6.7 billion range. And now I'm not asking you to endorse those numbers, but I guess the question is, from a supply chain perspective, has the team secured enough capacity to drive higher revenues in July and October quarter if your backlog supported that profile?",Hock Tan,President and CEO,"You are really asking me to guide you, don't you? And I'm not guiding you. But I do understand your question, and you have seen in my prepared remarks just earlier of where we see ourselves planning are the trend to go. I've also specifically mentioned where we are manufacturing like FBAR in-house, which is a big part of what is the upcycle in the seasonal upcycle in the back half on wireless side that we have put in place, the capacity to handle it.

Thanks for taking my question. So, Hawk, you're saying that you're stretching out lead times. I get it, but I think before you told us the lead times were six months. So if you're stretching them out, where are they actually sitting today, and how does that maybe vary by end mark? And I guess to that end, you said you're kind of convinced that what you're shipping now sort of represents end-user consumptions. How do you actually have any visibility into that? And do you think the users, I mean, are the products actually going into end products? How do you know the users aren't stockpiling them and ordering them while they can? How do you have any visibility into what they're doing with them?",Hock Tan,President and CEO,"That's a hell of a good question, by the way. And it cuts to the core of the work we've been doing. We've never been working harder simply because, number one, it's Don't forget, we do supply, I mean we supply a range of products and we do supply to a bunch of customers. But keep in mind, if I could remind you of the business model we have built up, the structure we have built up. We provide technology leadership products in multiple verticals, mostly connectivity, into the IT space. And where we are, we're the leader. Where we play, we tend to be leader. And we play with leading customers worldwide. We know who those guys are. We know their level of consumption. And in many areas where we go, and we're talking end user demand. We're not talking about middlemen like distributors for sure. We indicated we don't, for our leading customers, we don't go to distributors. And for OEMs, we track that because who they sell that end demand, that goes for our products to OEMs. is where it counts at the end of the day. And in many cases, in one segment in particular, server storage, but it also applies to some extent and part of our networking business and to a much lesser extent in our broadband business, for sure. We actually see the difference in terms of whether it's just inventory depletion at original equipment manufacturers or even buffer inventories sitting in end users versus actually using the products in the same quarter we ship them the products. We track that. And that's really, and for us, it's not that complex when you think about our revenues. In semiconductors, 75% of our revenues really goes to just over 100 customers worldwide.

Now that you have Symantec for a year and CA for a couple years, can you just talk about the confidence of the growth rates on a longer-term basis that you're talking about? I know you touched on the 90% recurring, but just really how the global logic counts or how that transition is playing out.",Hock Tan,President and CEO,"Yes. As I indicated in my prepared remarks on some of the key metrics we go by, we feel very, very good about those two. We feel very good that things are moving along, tracking along where we, both the business and financial model, where we expect them to go, which is about focusing on core customers and truly uplifting capacity, entitlements, products, to those core customers across our portfolio. And you've seen the metrics we indicated, the increase. And on non-core, what I said previously is we do see a level of attrition manageable, but it won't. And as the attrition is offset by improvement in core, we expect to be able to reach a stabilization, as I said, around mid-single digits on a very consistent basis. And we have seen that two years now, that we have gone through over two years now, and we've seen that happen. We have seen eight quarters, nine quarters to be exact, of that level of performance, and it's a great line of sight. The other thing I might add that is also interesting, and I know stating the obvious to some extent is, most of all our customers, if not all of them, are enterprises, even in this environment. You heard what I thought about enterprise in semiconductors and how the different approach, the different characteristics and behavior enterprises have in terms of demand requirements in this environment of a pandemic work from home compared to telcos, broadband, and public cloud.

You know, the dividend component is pretty predictable, but outside of the dividend, how are you thinking about, you know, paying down debt, buying back stock, and M&A and software? You know, the markets are clearly, you know, very volatile right now, but how are you thinking about those three buckets on a relative basis?

We endowed business model and strategy, as you know, long-term is to acquire and add on to our portfolio, add on to our earning stream for our shareholders. and we take that very seriously, and we continue to look at it very seriously. And this takes time, and we continue to look at it, and we will take an approach, my point, that we would be somewhat flexible to, that as we accumulate cash, and by end of this fiscal year, we haven't done an acquisition, Well, obviously, take a hard look at our two other choices.

Don't forget there is some timing adjustment by quarter to blame in the sense that what used to be a peak quarter in our wireless seasonality of a fiscal Q4 in In this recent generation, the peak quarter, as I indicated, became Q1 of 21. So obviously, things roll down perhaps somewhat slower. And because we're also assuming, as it rolls down slower in the course of fiscal 21, that we have to assume, for lack of knowing no better, that we might be back to a normal seasonal cadence of a wireless launch of new phones and assume that you will be back to that normal cadence.

Hey, thank you. Hey, guys. Congratulations. Solid numbers. I've got a question for you. I'm trying to wrap my head around some stunning numbers you threw out for networking. 80% increase in bookings, some 62% odd sequential increase. I appreciate the process of identifying real demand. So with that, is there something going on in bookings that is specific to your end markets or your product set that is driving it? Could you just highlight what is going on there?",Hock Tan,President and CEO,"Yeah, great question. And I've been dancing around saying it in nice words. Let me call it directly. People need our products. Each of our products, in particular, whether it's broadband or networking, our customers, our end-user customers, truly need the products. I mean, they're in the business. They're in the business of launching more broadband, improving their networks. The cloud guys have to scale out data centers because there's more demand for hosting and demand from public cloud in this work-from-home environment of social media and also online retail and everything else. So they need to buy those products of ours, whether it's the current generation which we have that works or soon to be the next generation. So if we stretch our lead time to an extended basis, the thinking in their mind is these are non-cancellable orders. Do I still need it? six months, nine months from now. If they need it, they place an order. Otherwise, they have a gap in being able to scale out capacity or scale out launches. They'll do that. It's a real test of how strong our product franchises and how mission critical it is to our end users. And so as we stretch our lead time, whether it goes from three months to six months to eight months, they just book what they need eight months out, or first three months out first, then six months out, then eight months out. And you only do that if you truly believe you need that product to enable your business. And what I'm trying to say is, If nothing more fundamental than why we are seeing as we stretch out lead time because we match it against our ability to get those products out is a great way to indicate whether our products are needed. They don't need it now as much as people might seem to indicate. They may need it three, six months from now, but they're willing to lock in and say they need it so that we can manage our supply chain to get them those products, which is why I'm also saying the management of a supply chain to match demand is not that extreme an example as may be made out there that you hear around. It's all about being able to tell your customers and get your customers to behave in a rational manner and for us to manage it in a rational manner. I mean, if I should have my entire backlog today, assuming I can even do that, of course they'll take it because they're all in the pending mode. But if on the other side they know they can get it when they need it six months from now, they're happy to wait until then. Meanwhile, they book it ahead of time because that's what I need to reserve my capacity. And that's the perspective I want to give to you guys. It is what it is. This is not a panic mode.

Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hawk, I've got two quick ones. First, within your wireless business, you've been able to sign long-term contracts with your key customer, and I'd argue that's that's benefited both you and them. It's given you the confidence to invest in the business properly and then the confidence that you'll have supply for them when they need it. I'm just kind of curious, given how tight things are elsewhere in the semi-business, have you been able to parlay this into any longer-term customer contracts and what implication might that have as we all start to worry about the quote-unquote end of cycle? And then secondly, just on your comments about enterprise recovery, can you elaborate on that? Was that specifically a storage comment, or is that also a networking comment?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Okay, let me take the question one at a time. On arrangements with long-term agreements, John, this is something we have been thoughtfully, carefully putting in place with our core strategic customers. We just don't go do it as if it's commoditized. We're very thoughtful about doing it, and we do it in very specific areas where we know for sure that the technology is fairly, fairly difficult, complex to manage, and which requires a substantial amount of R&D spending. And we've been doing it for a while now with strategic customers in core businesses. So we just don't do it across the board. And what you pointed out is very, very correct. It's a mutual, it's a structure, it's an agreement with mutual benefit. We have the confidence to invest in R&D to make CapEx capacity investment. And in return, we offer the best leading edge technology in specific areas. in a timely manner to our critical customers. So, yes, we have been doing it, and we will continue to thoughtfully do it in a very appropriate manner.

As you notice in my comments, We classified service providers, telcos, as a separate animal, different from traditional enterprise. And so, as I pointed out, based on broadband, telcos have been investing big time. Service provider telcos have been investing in a huge manner over the past 12 months. But traditional enterprise, the companies, whether it's the banks, the manufacturing sector, various retail customers, airlines, examples. No, these guys are in a recovery mode and not surprising. We are seeing pandemic easing, like say in North America, and as it eases, we see a step up in spending, but we do not see spending spiking up. Now, obviously, if you look at You know, some businesses like warehouses that require Wi-Fi networks, campus networking environment, you do see that improving. But to say across the board all enterprises are just spending money, we are still seeing And as I showed that in service storage connectivity, we still see a year and year, year and year, things are not up to what it was a year ago.

Great job on the quarterly execution, strong margins, and free cash flow generations. Hawk, you know, I think as you mentioned, we're still in the early phases of the 400 gig networking upgrade cycle with your hyperscale and telco customers. I know two of your big cloud typing customers have already started the upgrade. Looks like there are another two more that are going to start the upgrade cycle here in the second half of this year and quite a bit more next year. And then, as you mentioned, you still have Tomahawk 4 ahead of you. So given the extended visibility that the team has with a strong backlog, do you see the cloud and telco upgrade cycle and inevitable recovery in enterprise driving continued year-over-year growth in networking into next year?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"You know, we don't really try to guide more than one quarter at a time, first of all, because we're not that smart to be able to do that. But on a broader trajectory, it does appear fairly much the trend, as we see it, which is, you know, the hypercloud guys won't push out in the second half, as I indicated earlier. on their data center side on Tomahawk 4, the 800G platform. In fact, we have some potential backlog for delivery in the back half of the year for Tomahawk 4. So we see that going on, and you're right, we see the recovery step by step of enterprise though I do not see that really taking off in terms of reaching the level it was a year ago, probably until 2022. But what we do not know for sure is would that give pause to hypercloud in their spending? And that part, I'm just putting everything on the table. We're not sure whether hypercloud spending will necessarily continue into 2022. We sense it would. We see some of the backlog, but As enterprise steps up, one never knows if the economy starts to rebalance in that side. But what we do see in broadband is service providers, the telcos in particular, are for sure upgrading.

Thanks for having me ask a question. Congrats on the strong results. Huck, I wanted to dive a little bit into the lead time commentary that you had with that stabilizing. Two quarters ago, you talked about the size of the backlog you had. Last quarter, you talked about the year-over-year and even, in some instances, the sequential growth being so large in bookings. And now we're hearing that the lead times are stabilizing. people can interpret that a bunch of different ways as far as the implication on the demand side of the equation or that supply is catching up to it or, frankly, people are just ordering so far out that they're not willing to extend that any further. So I was hoping to double-click on that lead time commentary and get your feelings as to why it's stabilizing, and do you take that as a positive or a negative?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Oh, I just make a comment to say we have stretched our lead time so far, Ross. Good point you bring up, and I'm glad you bring it up to give me a chance to clarify a set of quick comments I made in my opening remarks, that we are comfortable at the lead times we are on. And so what it is is our customers are comfortable seeing our lead time now. But what we have found rather remarkable over the last quarter is that even as our lead times remain stable, consistent, The volume of bookings we receive every week continues to grow.

Hawk, I had another one on the supply situation. If there were no supply constraints, how fast would your semiconductor business be growing? And, you know, kind of part B of that is, What is driving the shortages for you right now, and what are you doing to resolve it, and do you have any kind of gut feel on when the supply situation will become normal? Thank you.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Well, I'll answer the first and the last. In between, I'm not sure. But on the first, we would not put ourselves in the situation, nor should anyone do it, because there's also... a certain amount. We do not want our customers, and I don't think any of our peers want to do that either, to buy, to hoard, to create buffers, to buy ahead of what they need. So we try to match, identify, as I said, and go through a process of rigorously understanding true end demand. In other words, we look for drop-date quantities, as the term is used in the industry. And we ship to those drop-dead quantities and maybe a little more. And what you see today is the true growth rate we are representing. We are not hiding what could have been. There's no what could have been. We're shipping to what we believe customers consider is the true real demand. Now having said that, we may be delivering, doing JIT just in time, but nonetheless, we do try to fulfill what customer truly wants just on a timely basis. And that still continues today, regardless of the size of the backlog we have. We're disciplined in that regard. And from our perspective, you know, the challenges we have in the supply chain is a constant set of challenges is to ensure that we get components, whether it's wafers, substrates, getting our products assembled, tested, and any other small components on a timely basis to make sure that we can keep this thing running. And if you look at the size of our inventory versus the size of our cost of goods sold or revenue quarterly, you can see that we run pretty close to just in time through our entire supply chain. And we've been able to do it and sustain that. And so what we're reporting to you, like 20%, year-on-year growth on semiconductor components is, in our view, a pretty decent reflection what is truly end-demand needs out there. All right?

I guess I wanted to ask you what you think the long-term growth rate is of your semiconductor business. You're sort of trending to the high teens this year, but that's kind of due to easy comps and you have the compressed iPhone launch and the pull forward of some of these technologies, you know, due to the, you know, due to the pandemic.

Are you still thinking 5% or do you think maybe just given the strength of the bookings recently that it could be, you know, better than that? Thanks.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"That's a hell of a question, and I'll tell you this. Right now, we're in the midst of a very strong demand, and that's also created, perhaps, as we all know, about a severe imbalance between demand and supply, as supply works to catch up. But if you look at it long enough, I think the dynamics underlying the fundamental dynamics underlying the semiconductor industry hasn't yet changed. At least I haven't seen it to change. So, Tim, that's the only best answer I can give you, which is I haven't changed my thinking if you look over the next 10 years how this industry will behave, because it is a relatively matured industry. It's evolutionary. Technology is still evolving, which is great for us, and it keeps getting better and better, but it's evolving.

Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, a little more detail on the gross margin. It's a record gross margin. Any color on product or segment? And then I guess as you look forward here, If you could describe what you're still dealing with in terms of excess costs due to COVID, and then how to think about it as enterprise comes back, should that be added to the gross margin?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"I expect gross margin next quarter to be about the same as it was this quarter. And then, as you know, at the end of the year, we're expecting wireless to come back in for the normal ramp that we have. And so the margins will come down a bit towards the end of the year. But at this point, I see us being able to sustain the margins that we experienced this quarter, mostly coming from networking and broadband. Blaine, at the risk of perhaps repeating myself too much from past conversations that I had with all you guys, our gross margin has this natural trend of continuing to keep expanding year on year. not necessary quarter on quarter, but sequentially as much as year on year, simply because we tend to have a chance to go to a new product, new next generation product across some of our franchise products. And it's a combination of all this. So the natural growth or expansion of gross margin for our business, especially in the semi-site, Particularly in the semi-site, which I assume your question is related to, Blaine, is, as I've always said, we have a gross margin expansion range of 50 to 150 basis points year by year. And it's an average across our 24, 25 different, well, I should take out software here. just hardware, about 20 or so different product lines, each with a different product life cycle, and each going to its new generation product each time. Because as you know, each time we come to a new generation product, we get a list in margins, in product margins, which translates to gross margin. So it's not unusual to see us go to the higher end of the range. And in this particular case, year on year, it's been more than a higher end of a range, and that's probably... are related to perhaps a separate mix of products in this environment because there are still puts and takes across our product range. Not everything is on fire. And based on that, we end up with higher than the normal 50 to 150 basis point range. But I don't think this is something that will go on forever.

Thank you so much for taking my questions. I had two, actually, one on wireless and one on the cost side. Hawk, in terms of wireless, I guess in Q2 revenue came in better than expected. I just wanted to understand, was that primarily supply being better, or were there dynamics on the demand side that came in better than expected? And then sticking to wireless, as you think about the next ??the next generation product cycle at your largest customer, how are you thinking about the content opportunity at this point? You pretty much know what's locked in. If you can comment on RF and Wi-Fi and touch and maybe compare and contrast this uplift in this cycle vis-a-vis past cycles, that would be super helpful. And then on the cost side, based on the comments you just made about gross margin expansion and some of Kirsten's comments, I doubt, you know, cost inflation is having impact on your business. But if you can speak to wafer pricing and substrates and, you know, what you're seeing from a cost perspective over the next year or so, that would be super helpful.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"All right. Let's start with the first one. And if I lost track of the last two, you better remind me. But on wireless, you're right. What I indicated was Q2. Wireless was kind of higher than we originally planned, and a lot related to demand. Of course it's demand. We will never ship just because we have the product. It's based on demand wanting it, and so we're happy to fulfill it. And part of the demand may actually come a bit from Q3. Not sure 100% yet, because this demand comes in short cycles, and it may, and perhaps that's why we are a bit careful about telling you Q3 year-on-year improvement is still 30-plus percent year-on-year growth. I'm not saying 40-plus. But we don't know for sure, except we know that we do pull in some from Q3 to Q2, not much, and that allows Q2 to perform that 48% year-on-year growth, which is great. But Q3 will still be pretty good year-on-year, as we fully expect. Related to content and all that, I prefer at this point in this sensitive arena with a highly sensitive situation to not answer that question at all. No offense, please, but I can't answer that question. But I'll be happy to take the third question, which is, yeah, we have cost inflation in this environment where As we all know, the semiconductor supply chain is under severe constraint on its ability to provide. Now, we are very large. We are a very large customer and a very loyal customer to many of our suppliers of our key components. And so we believe we are treated very well. Having said that, where prices are concerned, of course not. We see cost inflation, and in this environment, we are very, very open to talking to our customers who are in turn very open to being able to address cost inflation across cost pressure in a higher purchase price on their side.

Same question that was asked is, do I think the semiconductor industry for over the next 10, 20 years will grow any faster or slower. And my view is, no, I don't see any fundamental things that have changed. See, while we are in the thick of this storm, so to speak, of course, all hell breaks loose, as the expression goes. But these are cycles we all have seen many times in the semiconductor industry. And maybe this is a bit extreme in the context of the pandemic over the course of 2020 and now extending partly into 2021. But, you know, the supply will step up at some point and demand is always there because people need technology, people need the performance, need the technology that we all offer. the product we provide and we'll be competing the same way we have been competing and it's not necessarily related to creating long-term agreements or any such thing it's about being able to provide the best technology the best product in a timely manner for your customers and it doesn't matter that you do any agreements if at the end of the day you lack the technology or you lack the products that customers need to make themselves successful or to be able to deploy in a good manner.

Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hawk, I'm just kind of curious. You kind of did what you said you were going to do 90 days ago, but this is usually the part of the cycle, especially on the semi-business, where I would have expected more upside. And clearly, you know, when you look across the sector, most companies are putting up an upside that you guys didn't see in the July quarter. So I'm kind of curious if you can help us better understand what happened. Do you think that this was mostly ??supply issue, and given that inventory grew 15% sequentially in the quarter, to what extent do you think now that you've kind of got that under control and going forward you'll have a better supply environment to fulfill this demand?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Well, I mean, supply is always something that is very much an issue of constraint in this environment, as you well know. But the other side of the picture is We are really shipping, as we have said in previous calls several times, we are, put it directly, we are shipping to exactly, we believe, to what demand requires.

Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hawk, I wanted to touch on the enterprise business. You mentioned it a couple different times when you were talking about both networking and your server storage connectivity segments. So I guess a two-part question. One, how much of your semiconductor business do you believe is enterprise exposed? And two, when do you believe that will return to year-over-year growth? And is that a specific thing to Broadcom with your product cycles, or is it just the end markets returning to year-over-year growth at that time?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Okay. Well, enterprise, traditional enterprise as we define it, and I think I made a point of purposely demarcating the fact that in semiconductors, focusing on semiconductor segment by itself, you can literally look at our data as selling into three distinct elements, right? One is cloud. and service providers, which we clump together as one. And then there's consumer, which is very much our wireless business. And then the rest of the companies out there, enterprises, we call traditional enterprise. So we do put telcos, service providers, to make clear as part of cloud in that category. So we break it into three categories. And under that measure, enterprise represents about half just around half of the total semiconductor revenues. And to basically answer your question, which I did indicate in remarks on server storage and markets for semiconductor business, we have seen an improvement year on year of revenues in server storage, which is 80%, at least 90%, driven by traditional enterprise, so they are very good indicators of what traditional enterprise is showing. We have seen it show of improving year-on-year compares. And the latest Q3, still high, mid to high single-digit decline from a year ago. But we did also guide that Because of strong bookings that we have been seeing now for the last three months at least from enterprise, which is going through largely the large OEMs who integrate the products and sell it to end users, we are going to likely expect enterprise to grow double digits year on year in Q4.

Hawk, following up on that same question, last quarter you were predicting or you thought that the excellent growth you've seen in equity cloud server providers and telcos might lighten up next year as they digest that as enterprise started to grow and they'd be kind of a mix shift there. But it sounds like that isn't lightening up and enterprise is coming back a bit sooner. Do you think any differently now about telcos and service provider in the cloud? Will that last longer? Do you still expect to maybe lighten up in 2022? And how long do you expect the enterprise, it's been down for quite a while now, the enterprise upward trend, I'm just trying to get a feeling what the profile of demand looks like in your core business next year. Thanks. Sure.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Happy to do that. What we are seeing now, what we expect to see in 2022 in terms of broad direction is we see, you know, in telcos, service providers are running quite well, quite hard, and it looks like they are sustaining as opposed to perhaps rolling over. They seem to be sustaining where we are right now. Regarding enterprise, it's pretty much what we had indicated before and continue to see, which is a continuing trajectory of improving demand, spending and demand. And we see that continuing to improve and grow this coming quarter Q4 and beyond. In fact, I would say that the engine for growth for our semiconductor business in 2022 will likely be enterprise spending. Whether it's coming from networking, one sector for us, and or from server storage, which is largely enterprise, we see both this showing strong growth as we go into 2022. while, just to repeat myself, we see telcos and service providers not rolling over, just hanging up there at a very elevated level.",positive,0.59,neutral,0.704,positive,0.665,positive,0.723,positive,0.923,positive,0.97,4,0.59,0.0,0.665,0.723,0.923,0.97,2.271,0.0,1.8900000000000001,1.666,3.45,2.921,0,0,0,0,0,0

If I use normalized assumptions on cash, interest payments, cash taxes, and CapEx, looks like the team is going to generate about $13.7 billion-ish roughly in free cash flow this fiscal year, which roughly translates into a dividend increase to at least $16.70, maybe a bit more. if the team continues to return 50% of the free cash flow. I guess my question is, on Q4, are there any one-time cash events, timing-related dynamics, CapEx increases, or tax-related events which we should be considering? Or is my free cash flow and dividend math roughly correct? And then just a quick follow-up.

I actually just wanted to clarify something and then have the questions. On the clarification, I think, Hawk, you mentioned you're shipping to demand. Does it mean you're not seeing any supply shortages? And that would be very different than what we are hearing from every other semiconductor company. So I just wanted to make sure I had the right interpretation. And then my question is just kind of the long-term growth rate for Broadcom. You know, in the past, you have mentioned kind of this mid-single-digit kind of growth rate. I understand that this year, right, compares make it, you know, easier to grow faster than that. But as you look at Broadcom over the next, you know, handful of years, do you think you are in a situation to grow better than mid-single-digit growth rate? Like what is missing to make you upgrade, right, that mid-single-digit growth rate, the conceptual forecast that you have provided in the past? Okay.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Let me take the first part of the question first because I think it's very important and very interesting. It ties into the first question by John is, hey, why are you guys not shipping like crazy? Are you supply constrained? There's always overhanging our care about making every wafer count in this environment, and we do that very carefully. And we do that, I believe, very well, given in looking at how well our margins are performing in this environment. But we also always, as I said before a few times, with the way we manage our supply chain, we pretty much like to carefully scrutinize end demand as defined by ourselves, which is the end user who needs those products. What we also see, and I mentioned that in the industrial segment in 2017, in Q3, where resale from a distributor, as you know, industrial generally pretty much go through distributors. The end users just go to our distributors and wipe out our inventory, most of our inventory there. So we show a resale growth of 55%, and we all know that's not real demand. People are building up buffer. There's a certain level of panic buying. Take that across all segments of semiconductor markets today. You see that kind of behavior unless you, as core key suppliers, we put in careful discipline to manage supply to where demand is really needed as opposed to where OEMs or even end users are just building up buffers a bucket of buffers everywhere. And that's pretty much what we spend a lot of our time doing. I cannot necessarily say the same of many other semiconductor companies out there, which is probably why John Pitzer is saying, well, why are people showing bigger numbers? We can show bigger numbers, but that means we will build up. inventory in the wrong places. And we need every one of those wafers in this environment, not just this quarter, but next quarter and a quarter after that, to ensure that our strategic customers are able to get what they need to launch, to deploy programs. Right? And on the long-term growth rate, how Oh, sorry, missed that. Well, you know, I like to believe, like some of you do, that with this recent event and with these things happening, especially COVID-19, creating a change of work habits in our ecosystem, that there is a reset upwards towards a higher consumption of technology and by extension, semiconductor chips in the long term. I agree, there has been an accelerated adoption of certain technologies under these lockdown conditions in our lifestyle economy over the last 18 months. This accelerated adoption of technology has created strong growth demand for semiconductor products over this 12 months. I agree, and we report those results, which we believe are true and demand, as I indicated in a brief earlier part of my answer to your question, that it's now up to high, mid to high double-digit teens, so to speak, year on year. That's good, that's very strong. That's a far cry from my my model that says semiconductor grows long-term mid-single digits. But this accelerated consumption does not necessarily create a fundamental shift in our people's ability to consume technology, and when things revert back towards a more normal lifestyle, maybe not this year, maybe next year or the year after, I would expect this accelerated consumption would reset itself. And then you ask yourself, fundamentally, over the next 10 years, five, 10 years, is semiconductor consumption usage going to increase any higher? I find it hard to imagine why it should, if fundamentally, We have an industry that's relatively mature, still evolving, still changing, which makes it exciting for us, but pretty much been around fairly much a long time. And I may be wrong. I still think it will revert over the next five, ten years back to a norm. The question, your view is, will that norm be high single digits perhaps rather than mid-single digits? And you may be right. I don't know the answer to that. But right now, you're right, we are seeing 15 to 20% year-on-year demand usage of our semiconductor chips. And by the way, we are pretty broad across multiple end markets in applications of semiconductors. So we kind of represent a large part of the overall semiconductor growth. And now there may be particular that could grow faster than that mid-single digits, and I do accept that. But given how broad-based we are, I tend to think we revert to what will be the norm. And I cannot disagree with you that the norm might be higher than the mid-single digits I've said before.

Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you on broadband. It's been running kind of in the 20s year over year. You set up double digits for Q4. I think last year's an easy compare, so I just want to know how literally to take that. I know you said maybe over time that would be the one segment that could moderate. I just didn't know if you were signaling anything for October.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Okay. No, broadband is hot. to cut to the chase. It's hard. It's hard driven by two things, and I articulated that in my remarks. Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, and Wi-Fi is a big area now that service providers basically operate the telcos and cable operators are using as part of connectivity to households globally. And that's And we have literally won, again, a huge part of that market successfully. And we're seeing that trend continuing into next generation Wi-Fi 6E. But what's also driving broadband, I should say, and I mentioned that, is fiber. Fiber is, you know, several large telcos. are investing very big in putting fiber out there to households. It's particularly driven, I guess, to some extent by political considerations. They want to connect households very well. You hear about British telecoms openly saying they have a program over the next five, six years to connect over 20 million British households. Deutsche Camp Telekom is doing exactly the same thing, and so is AT&T here in the U.S., where they're a very large program. And this, as I indicated, multi-year programs where each of these operators will spend multiple billion of dollars of investment to put that fiber out to the home. And at the end of each node, fiber node, you have... that wireless connectivity, Wi-Fi, within for the last 100 feet in the home. So what I'm implying here is saying this is not a one-shot thing, and the thinking in the past that fiber is a kind of boring, single-digit, slow-growth business might be changing from our perspective because we are seeing the programs from those operators coming.

Thank you very much. Hawk, I noticed in your prepared script that you were a bit more specific about some of the leadership positions that Broadcom has in different levels of advanced certies, and you maybe called it out a bit more than you had in the past. an advantage the company's had in your own switching routing product, but also in being the preferred ASIC shop for a few hyperscale folks. I wonder if you might, did you call that out on purpose? Is there something changing there competitively given the scale of your R&D? Do you feel like that lead is expanding, shrinking, staying the same? Any update there would be great. Thank you.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Well, that's very perceptive of you, and the only reason I call that out is because it's true, and it's been true for many years, and just want to reemphasize this point that in terms of being probably the preferred vendor for specialized silicon engines, to drive specialized workloads. And I have indicated to you guys what some of those are, especially in hyper cloud. We definitely are in the lead by far in this area. And for the reasons you mentioned, we have the scale. We have a lot of the IP cores and the capability to do all those chips for those multiple hyper sites who can afford and are willing to to push the envelope on specialized offload, I used to call it offload computing engines, be they video transcoding, machine learning, even what people call DPUs, smart links, otherwise called, and various other specialized engines and security hardware that we put in place in multiple cloud guys.

Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the very solid results. I know you guys don't guide for the full year, but I was hoping you could ??kind of walk us through how you're thinking about fiscal year 22 on the semiconductor side. You know, obviously bookings have been strong, continue to be strong across most of your buckets or end markets within semis. But if you can talk about, you know, bookings trends in the quarter, what you're seeing there, that would be super helpful. And then as you sort of answer the fiscal 22 question, if you can touch on supply and to what extent supply could be a gaining factor over the next 12 months, that would be helpful.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Well, that's a hell of a question I may ask. So let me try to address in its various component parts. What we continue to see with the recovery, and I made a point of saying that we're now in the midst of a very strong spending recovery in enterprise, particularly. So we're continuing to see... strong demand bookings in the semiconductor side. But a big part of that demand, an increasing part of that demand, is now coming from enterprise spending, which translates to end markets, tends to drive a lot of our broadband, continuing to drive the broadband, which has been strong in most of 21, continuing to drive the enterprise part of our networking business, And, of course, server storage and industrial is just very, very strong. Having said that, on the hypercloud spending side, a lot of it resides in, obviously, in our networking business. Things are still very elevated. The demand continues to be strong. And so... When you combine all this together, we continue to see booking rates being at a fairly, continue to be a very elevated level week after week so far. And as of right now, we're pretty much poked all the way through 22 and even beyond 22 into 23. If you think about 15-week lead time, no surprise it goes to late 22, but we've gone even, in many cases now, gone beyond 22 into 23, and that's partly because, one, timing of our customers planning very far ahead, and two, as I said, our continuing disciplined approach to ensuring that we deliver products at the right time to the right place. And we see that going on.

Thanks for taking my question. Hawk, I wanted to follow up on those lead times and order times. So you said, obviously, on the industrial space, your channel's lean. It sounds like your bookings overall is very strong. At the same time, we know you've been taking efforts to limit, like, worries around stockpiling and overshipping, whether it's parsing orders, expediting. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are doing in that space. How are you feeling right now in terms of your shipments versus where end demand is? And how meaningful those long 50-plus week lead times actually are? Do they actually represent demand, even if it's that far out? If you could just talk about your efforts there, that'd be helpful.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Yeah. Well, we've been doing this 50 weeks now since the beginning of 21. And we've been delivering very much, as much as we can, to those lead times. So in some ways, I like to believe it's giving some method to this booking madness, I guess is what I would call it, in terms of our ability and in terms of how we are shipping the products. But by keeping lead times very stable and predictable, as we are doing now, we're also clearly communicating to our end users the way they should be planning their business. And I like to think all this is working out in terms of allowing us to, making sure we don't overship and build up buffer inventory through our ecosystem out there. That means distributors, channels, and customers. And all that is being done purposefully, the truth be told, that the day will come when things have to land, and we like to make sure it lands very gently and softly. And we like to think that is working very well. So what we are reporting in some sectors now, what we're guiding in some sectors and reporting where you see growth of some 20, 30%, I know, even from our perspective, it seems very hot, excessively hot. And in those areas in particular, we take strong particular attempt to make those attempts to ensure these products we ship are for programs that get deployed, rather than sit on the shelves for a future need. And so I like to believe that certain areas that grow in networking, Broadband service storage lately of some 20 to 30% year-on-year railed through end demand.",positive,0.637,neutral,0.598,positive,0.591,positive,0.877,positive,0.904,positive,0.975,2,0.637,0.0,0.591,0.877,0.904,0.975,1.252,0.0,1.2530000000000001,1.8279999999999998,1.82,1.9129999999999998,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just a quick follow-up along those lines on enterprise. You gave some numbers for year-over-year growth for things like networking and storage. Those year-over-year numbers, does that imply a sequential decline, especially for networking and storage? I'm not sure if my year-ago numbers are tied in or not, but Do you expect those businesses to decline sequentially within the context of the guidance?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"In May, depending then, we're talking mathematical numbers now and how we ship, because some of the shipments are lumpy, and you may see that from quarter to quarter when you talk about sequential quarter, you may sometimes see that, and what I'm trying to say, and we may also choose to deploy, supply, to one market versus another as you go quarter by quarter. So looking at it sequentially in specific verticals might sometimes, for our case, from our point of view, be rather misleading. Unintentionally, I may add, simply because we may choose to deploy our ship more to, for instance, sometimes to server storage because there is a hotter need there versus the networking.

Hock, you know, in your networking business, you've been somewhat conservative on your view on the sustainability of the strong cloud and hyperscale growth, but yet in cloud, I mean, you guys are ramping 7 nanometer Tomahawk 4 and Trident 4 up. They're in the early innings of the ramp. Demand is strong. You talked about Jericho and Qumran being strong in routing. Your cloud ASIC customer is ramping their 7-nanometer TPU, and you have more programs firing next year, as you mentioned. And then on the enterprise side, your large enterprise OEM customers are benefiting from the strong recovery. So you're starting off the fiscal year in networking with strong double-digits growth, but do you see your networking business continuing to drive double-digits year-over-year growth for the full year, and will the growth be driven by all three of your end markets, cloud, enterprise, and service provider?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Harlan, that's a hell of a question, and the only way I can answer that is if this is a way of training for me to ask me to guide you on networking for the year, ain't working. I'm not doing that. But you're right, though. There are a lot of levers. And I articulate quite a few of them. And maybe I over-say it in some cases. And they seem to be, as I use the expression, as we sit here today and going into 22, firing on all cylinders. And by that, I mean more than just forecasting. We've actually seen the backlog. We have the backlog, and they keep building up. And you're right, hyper-cloud, guys, like you would have asked me six months ago, I would not believe the level of spending that I'm embarking on right now in 2022. But they appear to be. So you're right, enterprise has been strong, and you've seen the rate of growth of enterprise year-on-year of 30% broadly And cloud has, at their current elevated levels we are seeing in networking, has not softened, has not weakened. It's still sustaining. Now it's not recovering obviously year on year basis as fast as enterprise is showing, simply because enterprise starting from a lower point. But cloud is still growing. We are seeing hyper cloud growing and is growing from not just switching and routing, that's our traditional strength, is growing now for us on, for want of a better expression, collectively called offload computing applications. From virtualization orchestration and more and more AI, beyond just the single lead customer we have in TPUs today.

You know, because for some time you were not as favorable towards buybacks So the $10 billion announcement, is that more a statement about business trend? Is it lack of M&A targets? Are you going to be more consistent in buybacks? So that's part A of the question. And part B is that if I take that $6 or $7 billion in dividends that you will pay next year and add the $10 billion in buybacks and apply the free cash flow range that you have, it suggests sales of somewhere in the low to mid-30s billion. using that math.

Our Q1 will exceed our Q4 shipments as we forecast today. So, yeah, it sounds like even that part is doing quite well.

I guess I'll ask the two questions, and then I'll listen to the answers for both the question and the follow-up. So first, Hawk, I want to revisit kind of the quality of demand and maybe ask it a different way. You've talked about undershipping what the actual demand or what your bookings are because you believe you can ship to actual demand. So that delta between what you're shipping and what is being booked, is that changing? Is it shrinking, growing, increasing? basically trying to get at any change in customer behavior. And then the second question will be separate and one for Kirsten. You mentioned about the OPEX and the semiconductor side rising going forward. Any more color about the linearity of OPEX as we go throughout the year, and any color on kind of the areas that would be focuses of that investment?",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"On the first, Ross, that's a very, very clever question, I might add. Has anything changed between what we're booking versus what we're shipping. I'm trying to answer not because, I'm not trying to answer it, it's because the demand by verticals have rotated somewhat. And you can probably understand it. So what I'm saying is, one clear example is what I'm saying now. Enterprise is actually waking up big time, And they are asking for products. They're asking for products in a very, very urgent manner. And so we're seeing a lot more shipments to OEMs who support those enterprises. And by verticals, we are seeing strength in basically in server storage in particular, and also the enterprise portion of networking, hence the strength in, as I mentioned, campus switching and Wi-Fi in many ways, because enterprise, you know, campus switching now for enterprise switching needs a wireless strategy component, and so we're seeing our Wi-Fi business for access gateways in enterprise really take off now. Having said that, our classification of cloud includes telcos, service providers. They've been steady. It's interesting, cloud and telcos have been steady, but they've been steady in different manner. The cloud guys are now pushing more and more into compute overload. I mean, the programs you're working on starting to manifest as deployment. So we're seeing that. And that is really driving some more growth than just normal switching and routing that we have seen super strong in 2021. We've seen areas like in some of their very massive scale out of machine learning or AI networks. Here you need a different kind of performance of those networks. So we've seen a different kind of products going into that areas. And I may highlight in my remarks about Jericho being going into many of those AI networks in the hypercloud. And of course, 5G continues to be, goes through cycles and happened to be a cycle 5G deployment and backhaul is strong and we ship a lot of Qumrans. So it varies, but if you take it from a macro point of view, hasn't changed from six months ago, Ross, which is the undershipment from the level of bookings we're seeing.",positive,0.588,neutral,0.652,positive,0.592,positive,0.95,positive,0.905,positive,0.979,7,0.588,0.0,0.592,0.95,0.905,0.979,3.594,0.0,3.27,5.402,6.242,6.6739999999999995,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for letting me ask the question, and congratulations on the strong results. Hawk, maybe just a follow-on to Ross's question about the R&D commentary that Kirsten had in the prepared comments. You know, with the growth that you're expecting in the semi-R&D, do you think that that will outstrip the semiconductor revenue growth for the year or not? And not having had the time yet to go back and look, is this an unusual spend year? And if so, what's driving it? Is it concern about increased competition? Is it the opportunity set? getting a lot bigger, and kind of what areas are you focused on? And then I have a follow-up.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Oh, I think we have continued to have been spending on R&D in the silicon site on a fairly consistent basis. And so we have. But in some other areas, and it's not so much about worry about competition as See, the underlying part of our business model across our various franchises is simply that we always out-invest, out-engineer anybody else in the verticals, in those franchise verticals we are in. And so from our point of view, hey, now is a great, you know, during COVID-19 in 20 and in part of 21, things were not moving as fast as perhaps we believe a normal cadence of product cycle turnovers should be, product life cycle. So we are now jumping in 22 to basically bring it back up to where it should be in terms of a normal product cycle cadences. And in that sense, you're right. It's not because of competition. It's because we believe we need to deliver this new generation of products with better features, better bandwidth, low latency to our customers who are now ready and willing to take it on. And having said that, we invest now. You don't see the impact of that probably until 23, 24. But we feel that There's some hiatus of new technology being absorbed in 2021.

And that's my follow-up, Hock. You guys have set up a really consistent track record around the dividend, but buybacks have been a little bit more episodic, especially given the M&A strategy. Just with the authorization today, is the intent to do all of that within the next 12 months? Why not an ASR component around that authorization today just to give investors confidence that you will follow through on the buyback?",Kirsten Spears,Chief Financial Officer,"Good point. But we intend to do this $10 billion. And the reason we're doing it, as you guys can gather, is We haven't done a deal in, we did not do a deal in 20, did not do a deal in 21, and got tons of cash, we have piled up a ton of cash, and debt has actually somewhat, the growth debt has actually declined somewhat while our cash position is building up. And while we may still do a deal in 22, it's just that we will still be generating a lot more cash in 22. So when you add up this whole thing, It's just a very logical conclusion for us to not just sit on the cash, hoard it in some ways you might call it, but just return it to you guys as we continue to accumulate cash. And keep in mind, we still have a lot of debt and grow expanding debt capacity as our EBITDA expands. And still be within investment grade, of course. And this is Kirsten. We have consistently said that we would return capital to shareholders if we didn't announce an M&A by December. And so this is in line with what we've been saying, and we plan to follow through on it. The $10 billion authorization will be executed pursuant to a trading plan, and it will be thoughtful and in line with what we said we'd do. Perfect. Thanks, Kirsten.

Harki, you called out your ASIC business. I think you said it's roughly 20% of the networking business and also said it's going to be about $2 billion. I'm just curious if you could maybe provide us some additional color as to what's going on with that business. You've been a leader in this market historically, and are you seeing more interest given what's going on with the hyperscale customers and their interest in developing in-house silicon, or is this a continuation of a trend, or any additional color you could provide? I think that would be helpful.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Right. Thank you for that. And by the way, our ASIC business is actually larger than the $2 billion we indicated. It's only that part of the ASIC business sitting in networking that we highlighted. is actually there are a couple other areas where we do ASIC, and it's done on a platform under a particular franchise business that we run fairly separately as one of the product divisions. But you're right, though, the larger part of it sits in networking. And a big part, and it's half of it, roughly, I would say, maybe growing more than half now, is to the hyper cloud. is to OEMs to still remain very much OEM-related business as well. And you're right, but your point is well taken. This is a steady, stable business and growing over time that we've had for many, many years. And it has, as I said, a long time ago, 20, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, been very much on networking, Merchant Silicon showed up in networking, which is switching and routing, and it has not grown as much in networking. But in its place, having said that, other opportunities show up. A lot of it is what I call collectively offload computing, which is very much tied to hyper cloud. And that has been slowly but steadily growing. But it's slow, and it's not something that shoots up exponentially overnight. Because a lot of the hyper cloud guys, much as they have ambition to do their own designs, I like to make that point very clear, it's a very difficult thing for them to do. Because they can go out and hire silicon architects and designers, it doesn't mean you can define a chip, SOC, system on a chip, that addresses what they're looking for, whether it's transcoding, whether it's in security, or even in virtualization, or even in AI. It's hard when you don't do it on a full-time basis. So we have been working with these hypercloud guys for the last five years, and there's been fits and starts in many, many situations among these hypercloud guys. But the message I want to say is we're never giving up. We continue to work with them. And more slowly, more and more, after many tries, some of them become successful, more and more successful. And you see the trend of growth in our ASIC business for offload computing. I mean, if those of you have followed me consistently for the last three, four, five years, you have heard me talk about it three, four, five years ago. Then two years ago, I just shut up. Because it takes a while to get it going. And it's starting to translate into revenues and ramps now. And it will be a nice driver to growth, I believe, for us over the next year, two years, I would say. So I'm bringing it back up again.

And then... Just to follow up on wireless, obviously the current demand looks pretty healthy and supply is very tight. But I guess if you take maybe a couple of your view out there, it looks like there's somewhat of a concern about 5G cycle peaking. So I'm just curious about how you think about wireless, especially in terms of your content opportunities for the next couple of years.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Wireless is a great franchise. and it continues to chug along very well, and that's probably, I'm definitely wearing rose-tinted glasses in this environment because demand is good, and it's holding up still very well. Beyond that, I really don't know the answer to what you're saying. I do see content increasing over the next several years because we have various products, multiple products, not just one particular product. We have various products into every one of those very high-end smartphones. And that gives us opportunity to expand and to strengthen and increase our content. And we never really plan for unit increases, actually, in all our plans. plan on some content increase year after year, but never any unit increase. So I guess I don't, I stop thinking and worrying about whether the number of phones is going to decline in 5G in the next one or two years, as much as will the content decline?

I had two. The first is on customer behavior, and I'm wondering if you've seen any change there. So, you know, I guess the question really is around are you seeing any change in the portion of customers that want product inside of lead time and are willing to pay your expedite fees? And I guess does that sort of inform you to the degree to which your shipments or the orders are sort of matching underlying consumption? And then I had a second question, too.",Hawk Tan,President and CEO,"Not really. Because I think we have gone through it now for one year, and I think our customers have, most of them anyway, I can't say all of them, have started to plan their needs accordingly. Now, it doesn't mean they are perfect in their planning, and so occasionally it happens they come running in and ask for all the expedite deliveries within lead times, and we see that, and we work through that. But by and large, our customers are planning better and better because they have practiced at doing that. It doesn't mean it's perfect, and in some cases where we can't do it, they probably will look for if they can find alternatives. And to the extent there are alternatives, my competition gets some benefit on those spot situations. And that will happen. Because I love to be perfect, but we cannot be. And sometimes our customer misses, we miss. And that happens in situations, and because of previous commitments, we cannot obviously pull in their demand. But those are still happening. Is there a change since then? No, not for months.
